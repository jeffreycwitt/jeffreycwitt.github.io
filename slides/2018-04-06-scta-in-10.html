  ## Claim

  The binary between Digital Scholarly Editions and Printed Scholarly Editions is not only false
  but *harmful*.
</section>

<section data-transition="zoom" data-markdown>
  ## Why harmful?

  It is harmful because it reinforces an outmoded publishing paradigm, to which continued adherence works against what is now technologically possible.

  ## Problems the Old Paradigm

  * The old paradigm donflates data and presentation.
  * This welds data to a particular presentation.
  * This particular presentations restricts the data to a particular use.

</section>
<section data-markdown>

  ## Why this paradigm persists

  * Welding data to presentation is no longer technologicall required.
  * It lingers only because of social and political intransigence.

</section>
<section data-transition="zoom" data-markdown>
  ## Aims of the SCTA

  * The SCTA or Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive exists to break this social intransigence.
  * It exists to be a new type of social community dedicated to the publication of scholastic texts divorced from presentation, freeing that data to be used in a plurality of presentation for a plurality of use caes.

  ## What the SCTA does

  1. Maintain a set of domain specific standards, alongside, more general specifications, for the publication of textual data as data anywhere on the web.
  2. Helps publish this decentralized data by organizing it with detailed, domain specific metadata.
  3. Makes this metadata available through various APIs that client applications can make use of this data in anyway desired.
