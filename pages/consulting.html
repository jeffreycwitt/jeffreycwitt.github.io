  <p>
     I regularly and happily consult on a variety of Digital Humanities Projects.
   </p>
   <p>
     From giving lectures and seminars on topics in DH,
     to leading TEI and IIIF workshops,
     to advising individual DH projects at a strategic and technical level,
     I am eager to assist and support the wider DH community in any way I can.
   </p>
   <p>
     If interested, please contact me (jcwitt [at] loyola [dot] edu) for my rates.
     I happily and regularly try to work within project budgets.
