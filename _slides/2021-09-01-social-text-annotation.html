  <h3>Some advantages over the traditional "discussion board"</h3>

  <p class="fragment fade-in">Threaded discussions around precise and granular text selections</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-in">Text selections that remain embedded in context</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-in">Simultaneously allows distributed discussions (discussions can happen anywhere!) and connected discussion (discussions happening anywhere can be connected and discovered by everyone!)</p>

    ### Start annotating

    1. Let's start by everyone adding an annotation or two to my [sample course content](https://jeffreycwitt.com/pl339/docs/02-the-medium-is-the-message.html). 
    Browse around. Look for something interest and then add an annotation.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    2. As you make a comment, let's also add some agreed upon tags to help group our distributed discussions: 
    
    * "nd" ("needs discussion"), 
    * "important" (any passage that seems "important" to our class discussion), 
    * "gc" (glossary candidate / a word or phrase that needs definition).
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    3. Now, let's start expanding our discussion beyond this web page. The text includes a link to a chapter by Marshall McLuhan. Let's start annotation this text with questions and comments. Again, let's use tags to allow our distributed discussion to be collected. 
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    4. Finally, let's start googling. What other cool resources get find on the web that connect to our discussion. Can you add tags to the things you've found? Can you create links between annotations?
