  </section>

    <h3>Some advantages over the traditional "discussion board"</h3>
  
    <p class="fragment fade-in">Threaded discussions around precise and granular text selections</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">Discussions around granular texts remain embedded in their larger context</p>
    <p class="fragment fade-in">Discussions can be distributed (discussions can happen anywhere!) and connected (discussions happening anywhere can be connected and discovered by everyone!)</p>

    ### Start annotating

    1) Let's start by everyone adding an annotation or two to my [sample course content](https://jeffreycwitt.com/pl339/docs/02-the-medium-is-the-message.html). 
    Browse around. Look for something of interest and then add an annotation.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    2) Try responding to someone else's comment.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    3) Try creating a "page" annotation.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    4) Try searching for annotations by others.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    4) As you make a comment, let's also add some agreed upon tags to help group our distributed discussions.
      * "nd" ("needs discussion"), 
      * "important" (any passage that seems "important" to our class discussion), 
      * "gc" (glossary candidate / a word or phrase that needs definition).
      * "glossary" (provide a definition for the class of a important technical word or phrase)

    Either create a new comment or practicing editing one of your pre-existing comments.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    5) Now, let's start expanding our discussion beyond this web page. The text includes a link to a chapter by Marshall McLuhan. Let's start annotating this text with questions and comments. 
    
    * Again, let's use tags to allow our distributed discussion to be collected. 
    * Let's also start creating links: try to copy a link to one of your annotations on the McLuhan text and paste that link in another annotation on the course content page.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    7) Finally, let's start expanding and exploring. 
    
    Start looking around at the other course content pages and add new annotations. Try creating tags or links to connect these annotations. 
    
    Start googling for other cool resources on the web that connect to our discussion. Can you add tags or links to the things you've found?
