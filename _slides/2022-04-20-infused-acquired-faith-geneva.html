    "Our argument is taken from the authority of the Fathers, who admitted that Scripture and its truth are not certain to us by, nor confirmed to us, by another means other than from the testimony of the Holy Spirit."

    "If he spoke Latin, I would know what he meant [the apprehensive act]. 
    Yet how would I know whether or not he was telling me the truth? [the adjudicative act] ...within me,
     within the lodging of my thinking, there would speak a truth which is neither Hebrew 
     nor Greek nor Latin nor any barbarian tongue and which uses neither mouth 
     nor tongue as instruments and utters no audible syllable. 
     It would say: ‘What he is saying is true’. 
     And I being forthwith assured would say within confidence to the man possessed 
     by ‘What you say is true.’ But since I cannot question him, 
     I ask you who filled him when he declared what is true; 
     you my God I ask. ‘Spare my sins’. 
     You have granted to your servant to utter things; 
     grant also to me the power to understand them." 
     (Confessions XI, 3 (Transl. Chadwick)

  "...it is through a natural act of the will unaided by grace or by any preceding natural instinct or habitus that we acquire the habitus of faith. Thus, this habitus of faith, at least the acquired one, is reduced to being merely the disposition of the intellect to adhere to the objects of faith. This disposition is extremely strong since by itself it constrains the intellect to assent, independently of any further involvement of the will..." (Faucher)

    "The papists say that we believe Scripture from the voice and authority of the Church. I ask therefore what this faith is? Is it acquired or infused? They call faith acquired which is compared to human persuasion and our own study. But they call faith infused which the Holy Spirit planted and inspired into our hearts"
