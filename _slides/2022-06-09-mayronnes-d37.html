  "For some say that, just as God is intensively infinite, so he is extensively infinite, not that he has part outside part, but that he is able to coexist in infinite places."

  "Alexander of Hales, St. Albert the Great, Odo Rigald, and St. Bonaventure are allied in teaching that God is omnipresent **not only** because of His operation in all things but also because of his infinite perfection, which reasons, however, they never intended to be mutually exclusive."

  "It is able to be said that though God has infinite intensity, nevertheless he does not have extensive infinitude or infinite magnitude, which are imagined by the preceding arguments, therefore they do not conclude."

  "the second way for some people is the way of causality. For it is necessary for the agent to be present and near to the patient, but God acts everywhere, therefore etc."

  "'where' (*ubi*) indicates a relation of something placed ("locatus" or "located") to a place (locus), and this is a relation that God does not have.""  
  
  On the other hand, he also says that:
  
  "'place' (*locus* or 'location') has a relation of "presence" (*praesentialitas*) to what 'is placed' (*locatus* or 'placed')"

  "therefore God would be said to be transferred from place to place through a new relation of presence in this place in which God previously was not, and from this God would be said to be in something in which he previously was not, just as it said above about a new creation which is in the creature, and without anything new in God"

  "if God created a star, but destroyed the heavens, he would still be able to move it circularly. But he wouldn't be able to do this unless it had some relation to something. But since he has destroyed the heavens, it must retain some relation to God himself (ipsum)."

  "If God were to destroy the entire universe, with the exception of the "poles", then he would be able to join these poles together which would require perpendicular motion. But this perpendicular motion would not be possible without a relation of presence to a first [unmoving thing]."

  "God is able to move everything at the same time. But everything has to move in relation to something else, and in this case, they cannot be related to each other [since everything else is already moving]. Therefore, they must be moved in relation to God"
