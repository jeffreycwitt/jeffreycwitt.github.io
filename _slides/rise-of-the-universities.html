  1) "During recent years we have often received letters from different monasteries
  informing us that at their sacred services the brethren offered up prayers on
  our behalf, and we have observed that the thoughts contained in these letters,
  though in themselves most just, were expressed in uncouth language,
  and while pious devotion dictated the sentiments,
  the unlettered tongue was unable to express them aright."

  (trans. McCormick, Education of the Laity in the Early Middle Ages, 1912, p. 32)

    2) "Furthermore [we implore] that there be schools for children who shall learn (*legentium*) the Psalms, *notae*, chant, *computus*, grammar **in each monastery and bishopric**. Also, carefully correct (emendate) religious books, since often when some wish to pray correctly to God, they do so wrongly due to corrupted books. And do not allow your youths to corrupt them either by reading or writing, but if there is a need to copy a Gospel book, a psalter, or a sacramentary, then a man of mature age should do so with the utmost care."

<section data-markdown>
# Abelard
* b. 1079
* d. 1142
</section>
<section>
  <section data-markdown>
  # Abelard's Move to Paris
  * Studied with Roscelin in the Loire valley region
  * In 1102, Abelard decides to leave Roscelin and heads to Paris.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  # Why?
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  # Abelard describes Paris as:
  * “already a powerhouse”
  * “where the discipline of logic ‘had most especially been accustomed to flourish’.”

  <section data-markdown>
  # Abelard and the Schools of Paris
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    # The Cathedral School of Paris
    * Abelard first went to study at the school attached to the Cathedral of Paris, the site where the Cathedral of Notre Dame stands today.
    * He studied under the famous master of this school, William of Champeaux.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    # The "School" around St. Victor
    * William of Champeaux would soon leave the cathedral school in 1109 to retire to the monastery of St. Victor just outside the city walls.
    * He did not cease to teach, and thereby he continued to attract students to the area.
    * St. Victor would become the home of the "Vitorine School", led by scholars like Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor, who were famous for their study of the "mystical" tradition.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    # The "School" around St. Genevieve
    * Around the same time that William moved to St. Victor, Abelard set up camp in the vicinity of St. Genevieve.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    # The "School" around St. Germain de Pres.
    * Students and teachers were also gathering in the west outside the city walls in the vicinity of St. Germain de Pres.

    # Key Take Away
    * Schools like those associated with St. Victor, St. Genevieve, and St. Germain were close enough to the center of the city to reap the benefits of association and just far enough a way to be able to assert independence from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Paris.
    * This kind of connection and independence is a critical ingredient for a lively intellectual community to develop.

  ## Abelard's Search for an Appointment

  * During his time at Paris and its surrounding area, Abelard was always working to get an official and permanent appointment as a canon to one of these schools. Best of all was an appointment as a canon in the Cathedral School.

  3) "To obtain a secure appointment as a master, Abelard needed to be elected to a benefice by the canons of one of the great churches. Beneath this rank there were less formal -- and less secure -- teaching appointments in other churches or as assistants to masters." - Clanchy, *Abelard*, p. 69

  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard's Appointment as Master

  * In 1114 he receives the prestigious appointment as "Magister" at the Cathedral School of Paris.
  * From 1114-1117 he is the star academic of Paris
    * 4) "ever neck craned and every eye strained to see him when he went out in public" (Clanchy, p. 74)
    * 5) "students came crowding to him from all over France and even from extremities of Europe" (Clanchy, p. 74)

  # In Sum: What Abelard's Journey Teaches Us
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## 1. Uncordinated Swell Around Famous Cathedral Schools
  * Throughout the 12th century there was an unprecedented and uncoordinated swell of teachers and students in urban centers with established cathedral and church schools.
  * Paris, Bologna, and Oxford are prime medieval examples of this pattern.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## 2. Increased Mobility of European Population
  * Abelard's own story of moving from one church to another, struggling to navigate the tricky and delicate political waters in order to find a post where he could make a living is a testimony to the fast moving, chaotic, and fluid nature of advanced education at Paris in the 12th century.
  * The increasing mobility of the West European population (i.e. its willingness to travel for education), due to the growing wealth and security in European society at large, is a key reason for the rise of the universities in the 12th cetury.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## 3. Freedom and Independence
  * As Richard Southern states: this was a 6) "short time, broadly corresponding to the first half of the twelfth century when there was a wide opportunity for individual enterprise and for ruthless competition, which was never again so uncontrolled" (Richard Southern, qtd. in Clanchy, p. 75).
  * This ruthless competition comes at a cost. As seen in the portrait of Abelard's life, this competition comes with a lack of job security, lack of collective organization, in turn inviting political maneuvering, and even corruption.

  # The Growing Need for Structure and Organization
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  As we've seen, Paris included well-established, and internationally renowned schools (Saint Victor's, St. Geneviève's, and the Cathedral School)
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  These schools attracted all kinds of traveling scholars, hoping to study and teach, and hoping to find a place of security where this work could be permanently done.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  Finding this security in the increasingly crowded city of Paris grew ever more difficult.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  In order to provide this security, organization and bureaucracy became necessary.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  This process of unification and standardization was a unifying process. It was the process of forming a *UNIVERSITAS*.

  7) "The word *universitas* had, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, no specific application to a university; it connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form **their own association (*collegium*) to protect their rights**. Provided they were recognized either in common law or by some higher authority, they could elect their own officers, make statutes, and be represented as a legal person through a proctor or delegate" (Gordon Leff, Paris and Oxford Universities in the 13th and 14th centuries, (Wiley, 1968), p. 16-17)

  <!-- 8) "Item et quod magister Henricus Ludenschede, mag. in art. nacionis Anglicane, tunc baccallarius temptandus, examinandus et licenciandus in artibus, conventione
et pacto expressis convenit cum dicto subcancellario in summa sexdecim francorum pro praedicta, pro quibus dictus Ludenschede tradidit eidem subcancellario certa pignora ad valorem dictorum sexdecim francorum. Ratione cujusdam contractus seu promissionis dictus Ludenschede fuit licenciatus et expeditus, quo expedito dictus Ludenschede petiit pignora sua a dicto subcancellario, que pignora reddere noluit, propter quod in vico Cerbone egregie verberatus fuit, et sic dictus Ludenschede sua pignora recuperavit, fuitque propter quasi tota Universitas et vicini." (1511, art. 63 (Chart. Universitatis (1894), vol. 3, p. 362) -->

8) "Again it was the case that Master Henry Ludenschede, Master in Arts of the nation of England, at that time a bachelor to be tested, examined, and licensed in the arts, through convention and pact to the things expressed, agreed with the said sub-chancellor [Peter Plaoul] to the sum of 16 francs for the above named services, for which the said Ludenschede gave to the sub-chancellor a certain pledge worth the said 16 francs. By reason of this contract or promise the said Ludenschede was licensed and discharged, upon which discharge the said Ludenschede asked for his pledge back from the sub-chancellor, who did not wish to return it,
on account of which he was egregiously beaten on Cerbon Street [Sorbonne Street?], and in this way the said Ludenschede recuperated his pledge, and on account of this nearly the entire University and the surrounding vicinity was scandalized." (1511, art. 63 (Chart. Universitatis (1894), vol. 3, p. 362) (my translation).

<section data-markdown>
9) "Again, it was the case that John Basseti and Rirchard de Baudribosco, of the Nation of Normandy, gave a lunch to the said chancellor with two other friends of his in the College of Justice, for which a lot of money (multas peccunias) was spent." (1511, art. 73 (Chart. Universitatis (1894), vol. 3, p. 363) (my translation).

<section data-markdown>
10) "Again, it was the case that Peter Valleti, having been licensed, gave a lunch to the sub-chancellor with four other friends of his, in which about three francs were spent." (1511, art. 75 (Chart. Universitatis (1894), vol. 3, p. 363) (my translation).
</section>
<section data-markdown>
11) "Again it was the case that Peter Reguordi et William de Blesis, because they were poor and did not having anything to give, though they were of sufficient age, knowledge, and character were rejected from the exam at the [College] of Blessed Mary by the sub-chancellor and his friends, but they were admitted to the exam at St. Genevieve." (1511, art. 78 (Chart. Universitatis (1894), vol. 3, p. 363) (my translation).

  ### Independence of the Masters vis-a-vis the Chancellor
  12) "Each master is to have jurisdiction over his scholars. No one is to receive either schools or a house without the consent of the occupant, if he is able to obtain it. **No one is to receive a license from the chancellor or any one else through a gift of money, or furnishing a pledge or making an agreement.** Also, the masters and students can make among themselves or with others agreements and regulations, confirmed by a pledge, penalty or oath, about the following matters: namely, if a student is killed, mutilated or receives some outrageous injury and if justice is not done; for taxing the rent of Hospitia [lodging]; concerning the dress, burial, lectures and disputations; in such a manner, however, that the university is not scattered nor destroyed on this account."  (Robert de Courçon: Statutes for the University of Paris, 1215; Chart. Univ. Paris. 1, No. 20, P. 78.; trans. https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/courcon1.asp)
</section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ### Regulating teachers in the arts faculty

  13) "No one is to lecture at Paris in arts before he is twenty years old. He is to listen in arts at least six years, before he begins to lecture. He is to promise that he will lecture for at least two years, unless he is prevented by some good reason, which he ought to prove either in public or before the examiners. He must not be smirched by any infamy. When he is ready to lecture, **each one is to be examined according to the form contained in the letter of lord P. bishop of Paris (in which is contained the peace established between the chancellor and the students by the judges appointed by the lord pope**, approved and confirmed namely by the bishop and deacon of Troyes and by P. the bishop, and J. the chancellor of Paris)."

  ### Regulating teachers in the theology faculty

  14) "We decide concerning the theologians, that no one shall lecture at Paris before he is thirty-five years old, and not unless he has studied at least eight years, [later prolonged to 14 years] and has heard the books faithfully and in the schools. He is to listen in theology for five years, before he reads his own lectures in public. **No one of them is to lecture before the third hour on the days when the masters lecture.**"

  Robert de Courçon: Statutes for the University of Paris, 1215, [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/courcon1.asp](https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/courcon1.asp); Chart. Univ. Paris. 1, No. 20, P. 78.
