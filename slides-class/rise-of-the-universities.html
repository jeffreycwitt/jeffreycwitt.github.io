## Abelard
* b. 1079
* d. 1142
</section>
<section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard's Move to Paris
  * Studied with Roscelin in the Loire valley region
  * In 1102, Abelard decides to leave Roscelin and heads to Paris.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Why?
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard describes Paris as “already a powerhouse,” “where the discipline of logic ‘had most especially been accustomed to flourish’.”
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard and the Schools of Paris
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    ## The Cathedral School of Paris
    * Abelard first went to study at the school attached to the Cathedral of Paris, the site where the Cathedral of Notre Dame stands today.
    * He studied under the famous master of this school, William of Champeaux.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    ## The "School" around St. Victor
    * William of Champeaux would soon leave the cathedral school in 1109 to retire to the monastery of St. Victor just outside the city walls.
    * He did not cease to teach, and thereby he continued to attract students to the area.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    ## The "School" around St. Genevieve
    * Around the same time that William moved to St. Victor, Abelard set up camp in the vicinity of St. Genevieve.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    ## The "School" around St. Germain de Pres.
    * Students and teachers were also gathering in the west outside the city walls in the vicinity of St. Germain de Pres.

  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    ## Key Take Away
    * Schools like those associated with St. Victor, St. Genevieve, and St. Germain were close enough to the center of the city to reap the benefits of association and just far enough a way to be able to assert independence from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Paris.
    * This kind of connection and independence is a critical ingredient for a lively intellectual community to develop.
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard's Search for an Appointment

  * During his time at Paris and its surrounding area, Abelard was always working to get an official and permanent appointment as a canon to one of these schools. Best of all was an appointment as a canon in the Cathedral School.

  > "To obtain a secure appointment as a master, Abelard needed to be elected to a benefice by the canons of one of the great churches.
  Beneath this rank there were less formal -- and less secure -- teaching appointments in other churches or as assistants to masters." - Clanchy, *Abelard*, p. 69

  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ## Abelard's Appointment as Master

  * In 1114 he receives the prestigious appointment as "Magister" at the Cathedral School of Paris.
  * From 1114-1117 he is the star academic of Paris
    * "ever neck craned and every eye strained to see him when he went out in public" (Baker, p. 74)
    * "students cam crowding to him from all over France and even from extremities of Europe" (Baker, p. 74)

  # In Sum: What Abelard's Journey Teaches Us
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ### 1. Uncordinated Swell Around Famous Cathedral Schools
  * Throughout the 12th century there was an unprecedented and uncoordinated swell of teachers and students in urban centers with established cathedral and church schools.
  * Paris, Bologna, and Oxford are prime medieval examples of this pattern.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ### 2. Increased Mobility of European Population
  * Abelard's own story of moving from one church to another, struggling to navigate the tricky and delicate political waters in order to find a post where he could make a living is a testimony to the fast moving, chaotic, and fluid nature of advanced education at Paris in the 12th century.
  * The increasing mobility of the West European population (i.e. its willingness to travel for education), due to the growing wealth and security in European society at large, is a key reason for the rise of the universities in the 12th cetury.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  ### 3. Freedom and Independence
  * As Richard Southern states: this was a "short time, broadly corresponding to the first half of the twelfth century when there was a wide opportunity for individual enterprise and for ruthless competition, which was never again so uncontrolled" (see Baker, p. 75).
  * This ruthless competition comes at a cost. As seen in the portrait of Abelard's life, this competition comes with a lack of job security, lack of collective organization, in turn inviting political maneuvering, and even corruption.

  # The Growing Need for Structure and Organization
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  As we've seen, Paris included well-established, and internationally renowned schools (Saint Victor's, St. Geneviève's, and the Cathedral School)
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  These schools attracted all kinds of traveling scholars, hoping to study and teach, and hoping to find a place of security where this work could be permanently done.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  Finding this security in the increasingly crowded city of Paris grew ever more difficult.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  In order to provide this security, organization and bureaucracy became necessary.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
  This process of unification and standardization was a unifying process. It was the process of forming a *UNIVERSITAS*.
  </section>

## Two Kinds of Organization
1. Organization of Faculties and Curriculum
2. Organization of Licensing and Accreditation

  # The Organization of Faculties and Curriculum
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
* The Lower Faculty (modern parallel: undergraduate studies at a liberal arts school)
  * The Faculty of Arts (mp: college of the arts and sciences)
    * Trivium (mp: the core or humanities)
      * Grammar
      * Logic
      * Rhetoric
    * Quadrivium (modern parallel: your major that builds on the Core or the sciences)
      * Arithmetic
      * Geometry
      * Music
      * Astronomy
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    * The Superior Faculties (modern parallel: grad school)
      * The Faculty of Medicine (Selerno)
      * The Faculty of Law (Canon Law) (Bologna)
      * The Faculty of Theology (Paris)

  ### Regulating teachers in the arts faculty

  > No one is to lecture at Paris in arts before he is twenty years old. He is to listen in arts at least six years, before he begins to lecture. He is to promise that he will lecture for at least two years, unless he is prevented by some good reason, which he ought to prove either in public or before the examiners. He must not be smirched by any infamy. When he is ready to lecture, each one is to be examined according to the form contained in the letter of lord P. bishop of Paris (in which is contained the peace established between the chancellor and the students by the judges appointed by the lord pope, approved and confirmed namely by the bishop and deacon of Troyes and by P. the bishop, and J. the chancellor of Paris).

  <section data-markdown>

  ### Regulating teachers in the theology faculty

  >We decide concerning the theologians, that no one shall lecture at Paris before he is thirty-five years old, and not unless he has studied at least eight years, [later prolonged to 14 years] and has heard the books faithfully and in the schools. He is to listen in theology for five years, before he reads his own lectures in public. No one of them is to lecture before the third hour on the days when the masters lecture.

  ## Textbooks and Manuals

  Medieval universities become the source of textbooks whose influence was felt at provincial schools spread throughout Europe.
