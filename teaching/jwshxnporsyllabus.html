               <p>The impetus for this course first was my participation in an NEH Summer Institute
                  (2010): Representations of the 'Other': Jews in Medieval Christendom.
                  From this seminar, I then applied for a further grant from the <a href="http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/" target="_blank">Boston College Center for
                     Christian-Jewish Learning</a> to create a model syllabus that
                  would use both Christian and Jewish medieval primary texts, but would
                  also fit well within in a philosophy department. In my grant proposal, I
                  explained the project this way:
               </p>
               
               
               <p>"During the summer of 2010, I was fortunate to participate in five week seminar on
                  Jewish-Christian relations in the Middle Ages. This seminar, put on by
                  the National Endowment for the Humanities, brought together twenty
                  educators of English, history, religion, and philosophy. I was lucky to
                  be among the three graduate students admitted. The design of the program
                  was to help the gathered educators to acquire or further an expertise in
                  Jewish-Christian relations in the Middle Ages. The aim was that
                  educators could then use this acquired knowledge to enhance their own
                  undergraduate teaching. Five different scholars in various fields were
                  brought in to introduce us to the different aspects of this complex
                  history. I came away very much enriched by the seminar. I acquired a
                  much deeper knowledge of the social, political, and religious history
                  that constitutes much of the history of Jewish-Christian relations.
                  Likewise, I was fortunate to gain a familiarity with thinkers and texts
                  that I was not aware of beforehand. However, I also left slightly
                  perplexed. As one of the goals of the seminar was to equip us with
                  knowledge that we could then use in undergraduate teaching, it was not
                  immediately clear to me how I should construct a course for my own
                  discipline, philosophy.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>"I believe that part of the reason for this quandary is that is not always clear how
                  to engage the intellectual production of these thinkers in a systematic
                  way. It is much easier to proceed historically and create distinctions
                  and divisions across time and region. And this is what our seminar
                  primarily did. However things become more complex when one becomes
                  interested in the exchange and compatibility of ideas. Here the divide
                  between community, time, and even religion does not always provide us
                  with a very helpful picture of the exchange of ideas between Jews and
                  Christians. In fact, certain historical and religious divisions mask
                  genuine conceptual commonalities among Jewish and Christian thinkers as
                  well as deep differences between co-religionists.
               </p> 
               
               
               <p>"In light of this, I would like to undertake a very conscientious and detailed design
                  of a philosophy of religion course that would use the texts of Medieval
                  Jewish and Christian thinkers as its source texts, dividing them
                  according to the customary problems of philosophy of religion. Such a
                  course would not only provide a possible path in which the dynamic of
                  Jewish-Christian relations could enter into a mainstream philosophy
                  department, but it would also provide a different perspective from which
                  Jew and Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages can be compared and
                  contrasted ."

               <p>In response to this proposal I received the young scholars grant from the Center for
                  Christian-Jewish Learning to prepare the following syllabus and to make
                  it available online. I have prepared the syllabus under the direction of
                  <a href="http://www.bgu.ac.il/~lasker/" target="_blank">Daniel J. Lasker</a>,
                  the 2010-2011 Concoran Visiting Chair at Boston College and a world
                  expert on Jewish and Christian medieval polemical literature.

            <div>
               
               <p>The objectives of the course are two-fold. First, it is hoped that students will be
                  introduced to the classical problems of philosophy of religion as they
                  appear in their medieval forms. These problems are enduring and have
                  plagued philosophy from its inception to the modern day. Further, by
                  focusing on these problems, within a particular historical period,
                  students will be confronted with unusual and foreign perspectives on
                  these problems that one would not often find in purely contemporary
                  discussions. Likewise, because of the undeniable reliance of medieval
                  thought on the classical past, students will be forced to engage with
                  both the Aristotelian and Platonic traditions in deeper ways.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The second objective of this course is to become more familiar with common concerns
                  that characterize both Jewish and Christian philosophical approaches to
                  religion. Through comparing and contrasting these positions, we will be
                  attentive to the range of possible solutions to these common problems.
                  We will also look at the impetus for these solutions and try to assess
                  how and whether the religious background of each thinker informs their
                  attempted solution. In short, we will look to see how the
                  "particularist" claims of "particularist" religions affect and shape
                  philosophy's supposedly "universalist" and common approach to religious
                  concerns.

               <p>Semi-weekly responses that require students to struggle with major interpretative
                  questions. It is expected that students delve into some of the secondary
                  source material in forming their response.

               <p>A substantial research paper where students choose one of the core problems and focus
                  on a problematic aspect of Jewish/Christian responses. It is expected
                  that chosen problems will engage with both Jewish and Christian sources.
                  This may come about either through recognizing a common problem that
                  both traditions share or by noting a problem that is unique to a
                  particular tradition, and helping the reader to understand why this
                  problem is unique to only one of these two closely related religious
                  traditions.

               <p>Negotiating and articulating the relationship between faith and reason is a necessary
                  prologue to any philosophy religion. It is here that boundaries are
                  drawn and the formal identity of a philosophy of religion is established
                  in contrast to other approaches to religious truth. For the medievals,
                  the most dominant contrast with faith or theology, which typically takes
                  revealed data as its central starting point. However, understanding and
                  distinguishing between faith and reason was also important for the
                  medievals for another reason: namely, it was a serious and debated
                  question as to whether and to what extent faith could improve a
                  genuinely philosophical discourse.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>In this opening problem, we begin from Maimonides' reflections on the history and
                  influence
                  of "Kalam" in both Christian and Muslim forms. We will pay special
                  attention to what Maimonides understands by "Kalam" and his criticisms
                  of it. Some attention will be given to the ways modern scholarship has
                  criticized the historical narrative Maimonides provides. From here we
                  momentarily move backward in time to consider the work of Saadia and to
                  evaluate his approach to faith and reason in light of the narrative
                  given by Maimonides. Finally, we turn explicitly to the perspective on
                  faith and reason in the works of Thomas Aquinas. The views of Thomas
                  Aquinas will be put alongside those of Maimonides so that we can draw a
                  fruitful comparison. We will also try to assess the place that Aquinas
                  holds with respect to the Christian tradition itself, both with what
                  comes before and with what immediately follows.

               <p>In light of the importance of revealed data for medieval thinkers and their interest
                  in
                  its potential value for good philosophy, it makes sense to consider
                  early on whether or not there can be a philosophical justification for
                  this revealed data. Medieval Christians and Jews were certainly aware of
                  the need to find some way to justify and validate what they took to be
                  real and authoritative revelation. In short, reason plays a role in what
                  we choose to be our 'authorities'. Thus how revelation occurs and how it
                  can be identified as genuine were central preoccupations for Jews and
                  Christians alike. In this section we compare the philosophical
                  justifications of revelation and prophecy found in the Jewish sources of
                  Saadia, Maimonides, and Gersonides with the justifications found in
                  Aquinas and Duns Scotus.

               <h4 id="">Problem Description</h4>
               
               <p>The question of God's existence is the first and most foundational question of medieval
                  philosophical approaches to God. The quest to provide a rational account
                  for the beliefs of a religious system begins with the search for a
                  rational demonstration of the existence of God. 
               </p>
               
               <p>In this section, we consider first Maimonides' proofs for God's existence. Here, we
                  will be
                  introduced to the idea of the cosmological argument in particular and
                  the form this argument takes in both Aristotle's and Maimonides' work.
                  Of particular interest will be what these proofs seem to tell us about
                  who God is. The attributes of unity, incorporeality, and necessary
                  existence will be especially important as they will carry with them
                  ramifications for how philosophy may approach the religious doctrine of
                  creation (Problem IV) and the possibility of divine attributes (Problem
                  V). After looking a Maimonides' proofs, we compare these proofs with the
                  five-ways of Thomas Aquinas. To these arguments, we add a consideration
                  of Anselm's ontological argument and its fate in the medieval Christian
                  tradition.
               </p>
               
               <p>Central to our general consideration is the tension between the religious desire for
                  a
                  rational proof and religious dissatisfaction with the kind of God that a
                  philosophical proof seems to demand. A brief consideration of Judah
                  Halevi's critique of Aristotelian-like proofs will serve as helpful
                  example of this tension.

               <p>In light of the centrality of the cosmological argument for philosophical attempts
                  to
                  prove God's existence, we next turn to what these argument can tell us
                  about who God is and the manner in which he can and cannot relate to the
                  physical world. In particular, we focus on the difficulty of how an
                  immaterial being can have a causal role in physical change. We look
                  first at Aristotle's view of how God can (and cannot be) thought of as
                  the first cause. Secondly, we turn to the neo-Platonic qualifications of
                  Aristotle's idea. In surveying Aristotle's solution to this problem, we
                  will also be attentive to the close connection between this solution and
                  Aristotle's position on the eternity of the world. 
               </p>
               
               <p>With these fundamental conceptual problems and possible solutions in the background,
                  we move
                  to see how Jewish and Christian sources adopted, altered, or rejected
                  these philosophical approaches. Much time will be spent considering a
                  third view of creation - <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> -
                  against the Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic positions. Our attention will
                  be on how Jewish and Christian authors dealt with the philosophical
                  objections to <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> as well as how
                  far they thought reason could go toward either demonstrating the fact of
                  <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> or demonstrating its
                  impossibility. The latter question was particularly acute for medieval
                  thinkers, since Aristotle's beloved cosmological proof for God's
                  existence, at times, appeared to required that the world was eternal.
                  Maimonides and Aquinas together represent a middle ground in this
                  debate, arguing that: while reason cannot demonstrate <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>, neither can reason demonstrate the
                  necessity of the eternity of the world. In this way, they attempt to put
                  some distance between Aristotle and themselves. Further, in recognizing
                  the impotence of reason at this juncture, they established a place where
                  faith must become operative. As representatives of the two extremes, we
                  will look at the positions of Gersonides and John Pecham respectively.
                  Gersonides disagrees with Maimonides and believes that reason can
                  establish that <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> is not possible,
                  and we will further consider how he believes this to be perfectly
                  compatible with Jewish teaching. On the other hand, we will see in John
                  Pecham's debate with Aquinas, a view the claims to have found a genuine
                  demonstration against the eternity of the world and in support of the
                  doctrine <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>.

            <div> 
               
               <h4 id="">Problem Description</h4>
               
               <p>In this problem, we consider how philosophers have approached the question of human
                  speech
                  about God. As we explore the problem we follow a two-fold difficulty. On
                  the one hand, we analyze the way Jewish and Christian philosophers
                  assess the general applicability of human attributes to God. Much
                  attention will be given here to the philosophical commitment to God's
                  unity and by extension God's incorporeality. Are human words and
                  descriptions, formed in corporeal and multifarious reality, actually
                  applicable to God? Can they signify anything true? If so, how? On the
                  other hand, setting aside the problem of human language, we consider the
                  more fundamental question of whether a description of the divine is in
                  principle possible. This is a deeper ontological or metaphysical
                  question about God's nature. The answer to this question rests on the
                  nature of one's prior philosophical commitment to the simplicity of God.
                  The thinkers treated here will wrestle with the question of whether God
                  can have any attributes at all or whether attributes necessarily add
                  complexity into the essential nature of the divine.
               </p>
               
               <p>The problem for Jewish and Christians thinkers alike can be traced all the way back
                  to Moses'
                  encounter with God on Mount Sinai and his request that God reveal to him
                  His name. In our discussion, we begin by considering how Saadia and
                  Maimonides, armed with their established philosophical convictions,
                  navigate both of the above problems. Because of the highly
                  anthropomorphized language of Jewish canonical texts, the first problem
                  about the value of human language will be particularly acute. We will
                  watch to see how each philosopher explains how this anthropomorphized
                  language should be interpreted. In the <em>Guide</em>, I,
                  51-52 Maimonides catalogue five categories of attributes and assess
                  whether or not any of these attributes can be applied to God in
                  principle. From here we will turn to Gersonides' critique of Maimonides. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Turning from Jewish sources to Christian, we observe how Christian thinkers wrestle
                  with the
                  same twofold problem. We will look first to Aquinas's notion of God's
                  simplicity and his analogical approach to speech about God; for Aquinas,
                  this approach provides a middle way between pure equivocity and a kind
                  of speech about God that claims adequacy. Special attention will be
                  given to comparing this approach to that of Maimonides, noting both
                  similarities and differences. Finally, we will consider both Scotus's
                  argument for the possibility of univocal speech about God and his own
                  view about divine simplicity. We will also compare Scotus's disagreement
                  with Aquinas on the one hand and Gersonides's disagreement with
                  Maimonides on the other. Here we will look for common convictions behind
                  these two critiques.

               <p>In light of the evident centrality that the philosophical doctrine of divine simplicity
                  plays for both Jewish and Christian authors, it is worth our time to
                  explore the polemical role that this doctrine plays in Christian and
                  Jewish debates. The Christian doctrine of the Trinity lies at the center
                  of this debate and for Jewish thinkers (and often many Christian
                  thinkers) this doctrine challenges the rationality and philosophical
                  validity of Christian conceptions of God. In this debate, we will see
                  previously examined philosophical principles put to work, as they are
                  used to establish the boundaries of rationality, and consequently the
                  boudaries of true religion.

               <h4 id="">Problem Description</h4>
               
               <p>In this problem we begin with the puzzle of Aristotle's Book X of the <em>Ethics</em> and the difficulty it has posed for commentators since
                  it was written. Our attention will then turn to how Jewish and Christian
                  thinkers have (or have not) adopted Aristotle's convictions regarding
                  the happy life. Of particular interest is how these thinkers synthesize
                  Aristotle's vision(s) of happiness with the traditional religious
                  visions of the happy life as conveyed in their respective sacred
                  texts.
               </p>
               
               <p>After introducing ourselves to Aristotle, we turn first to Saadia and his general
                  praise of
                  the practical life. Here, we will be introduced to the Jewish notion of
                  "mitzvot" (or the laws of the Torah) and how it functions, either as a
                  mere preparation for the happy life or conversely as constitutive of the
                  happy life itself. Next, we turn to Maimonides' intellectualist vision
                  of the happy life and the value he assigns to both the practical life
                  and religious practice and ritual. In transitioning from Maimonides to
                  Aquinas, we will first turn back to Augustine's extremely influential
                  remarks on the happy life and the (im)possibility of achieving the happy
                  life in this life. We then meet Aquinas at a crossroads: where the
                  Aristotelian and Augustinian traditions seem opposed. Our focus will be
                  on how he attempts to synthesize these two separate traditions and bring
                  them into harmony. Specifically, he introduces two kinds of happiness,
                  natural and supernatural happiness. In light of this distinction between
                  kinds of happiness, we will look carefully at the role and the
                  importance of religious practice in comparison to the position of
                  Maimonides.

               <p>In this section we focus on the nature of law and the (im)possibility of its rational
                  justification. We start by looking at some of the concerns with a
                  project aimed at rationally justifying divinely revealed laws: concerns
                  voiced both in the early rabbinic period and debates within Kalam
                  between the Mut'azilites and the Ash'arites. From here we move to the
                  development of distinct categories of laws, with which reason relates in
                  different ways. We will look at Saadia first, who appears to shows a
                  willingness to recognize some laws which reason can explain and other
                  laws that reason cannot explain. Nevertheless, we will see that even
                  these latter laws can be seen to a have a rational basis. From here we
                  turn to Maimonides, who some see as being critical of the kind of
                  approached advanced by Saadia in a favor of an even more rationalist
                  approach to laws. Still, we will see Maimonides struggle to find
                  explanations for certain classes of laws. Eventually he will introduce
                  the notions of the first and second intentions of laws to help him deal
                  with those religious laws whose justification does not appear obvious to
                  common reason. Finally, we look at Aquinas, who makes a distinction
                  between four kinds of law. Our attention will focus especially on the
                  difference between Natural and Divine laws. However, we will also
                  consider Aquinas' reflection on the Old and New Laws and whether there
                  can be a rational justification for the creation of new obligations and
                  the abandonment of old obligations. In discussing this problem, students
                  will be introduced to common categories of ethical reasoning, such as
                  "consequentialist reasoning", "teleological or virtue ethics," and
                  "deontological commands."

               <h4 id="">Problem Description</h4>
               
               <p>In this section, we first introduce ourselves to the problem of evil in general, its
                  classical formulation, and the division of the problem into its
                  "evidental" and "logical" forms. Subsequently, we turn to an early
                  medieval text, foundational for all considerations of the problem of
                  evil: the <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>. From
                  Boethius' description of Lady Philosophy's answer to the problem of evil
                  and it's correlative conception of divine providence, we will see an
                  example of a fairly traditional philosophical solution to the problem of
                  evil and the kind of God that this solution presumes. Here we will be
                  introduced to the notion of evil as an actual "nothingness" or mere
                  privation of the good. With this initial solution in the background, we
                  can look to alternative solutions proposed by Boethius himself and later
                  Saadia. In each of these subsequent solutions, we will note certain
                  dissatisfactions with the easy dismissal of evil in a "privation theory"
                  and with the conception of God as an aloof and uninvolved observer. In
                  response, new solutions will be proposed that imagine a more interactive
                  God, who is involved with the minutia of creaturely affairs. In turn, we
                  can see justifications for suffering, which are  rooted in appeals to
                  the actions of individuals and to the contingent circumstances of each
                  particular moment. In our survey of both Boethius and Saadia, we will
                  also be attentive to the more strictly religious presuppositions that
                  underly their solutions: most notably, the ideas of immorality and the
                  after-life.
               </p>
               
               <p>Following our consideration of the traditional philosophical response and early reactions,
                  we
                  turn to the views of Maimonides, Gersonides, and Aquinas. These views
                  will be compared with the earlier views as well as with each other. In
                  particular, we will note how Maimonides and Gersonides return to a more
                  naturalistic notion of providence, and we will evaluate how this impacts
                  their solutions to the problem of evil. With the thought of these two
                  Jewish thinkers in the background, we will evaluate Aquinas' views on
                  providence and the extent to which suffering is a feature of the created
                  order or the result of particular decision of the divine will.

               <p>For our final problem, we focus on what philosophy has to say about the possibility
                  of an
                  afterlife and a bodily resurrection. This question takes on considerable
                  interest for us in light of the important role the notion of an
                  after-life played both for philosophy's attempt to make sense of
                  religious notions of happiness as well as for philosophy's attempt to
                  form a coherent explanation for the undeniable reality of suffering, 
               </p>
               
               <p>We focus first on the arguments for the immortality of the soul. We will compare
                  the responses given in the work of Saadia, Maimonides, and Aquinas,
                  while paying homage, where appropriate, to the Aristotelian foundation
                  underlying their reasoning.
               </p>
               
               <p>After considering the possibility of the immortality of the soul, we move to considerations
                  of the possibility of a bodily resurrection in the same authors. Here we
                  will be attentive to why this is such an important concern for these
                  religious philosophers as well as to the specifics of their arguments.
                  This final consideration will involve us in a larger question about
                  miracles. This larger question forms an effective conclusion for our
                  course. It brings together many of the themes that have already arisen
                  in earlier problems; most notably, we will be forced to reconsider God's
                  relationship to the created order and his ability to alter or violate
                  the laws of nature. Moreover we will have occasion to face once more the
                  question of what reason can understand and the possibility of what
                  reason cannot demonstrate.
