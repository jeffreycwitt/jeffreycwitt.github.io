         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p>Politics and Society is a survey course designed to introduce students to some of
            the most important developments in the history of modern political philosophy. In
            particular, this
            course aims to introduce students to the development of a web of issues surrounding
            the
            human person, reason, freedom, and the good life. Students will be asked to absorb
            modern philosophy’s long preoccupation with these issues, recognize the perennial
            difficulties that arise, and actively reflect on the consequences of their own
            views.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of political philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major
            political philosophers
            and their distinctive positions from the early modern to contemporary period. Be able
            to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.
         </p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase student's ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            politico-philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity
            to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in class.
         </p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of justice, happiness, moral conduct, and the life they want to
            live.
            Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation, i.e. develop an appetite
            for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize the difference between
            this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to describe the consequences
            and impact of a given politico-philosophical stance for one's own life and decisions:
            especially,
            the impact on what one values, how one thinks about injustice, freedom, and cooperation,
            and how one conceives of the good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (20%)</h3>
            
            <p>Class involvement means, first of
               all, coming to class. Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. This primarily
               means both having read the assigned text and having the day's reading out and ready
               to
               be marked. Thirdly, it means being an active participant in the classroom. At times
               we
               will have opportunities for discussion; someone who is involved in class will be a
               thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion. At other times, lectures will
               solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student will bring up helpful and
               appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input
               is
               called upon.
            </p>
            
            <p>To encourage you in the above three areas. I will keep attendance throughout the
               course. Because I know that things come up, people get sick, and emergencies happen,
               I
               will overlook your first two absences (excused or otherwise). After two absences,
               every absence will affect your overall participation grade. Since our class is
               primarily devoted to the reading of texts, it is imperative that you have your text
               (including assigned PDFs available on Moodle) with you in class in a printed form
               that
               you can mark up and take notes on. Accordingly, not having the assigned reading with
               you will count as not being present. Inappropriate use of cell phones during class
               
               will likewise count as an absence. During on-line class meetings, 
               unless you have spoken to me beforehand, 
               it is expected that you keep your camera on and remain an engaged participant
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               To further encourage the kind preparation that yields fruit in the classroom, 
               we will use small reading quizzes and reading discussion boards throughout the semester.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Discussion Board (10%):</em>
               There will be approximately 12 available reading discussions forums. 
               Because I know you will have busy weeks, 
               you do not need to participate in each discussion. But throughout the course of the
               semester, 
               you need to participate in 8 discussions. 
               (But as the goal of this assignment is to help you digest and actively respond to
               our readings, 
               you are encouraged to participate in any and all discussion forums).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               What does a full credit discussion forum participation look like? 
               To get credit you need to participate at least twice in any given discussion, 
               either by introducing a new topic/thread posing a question for the class
               or responding to a peer's original post or another response. 
               To encourage interaction, discussion boards will be limited to 3 topic threads. 
               After 3 threads have been initiated, you can then ONLY respond to an existing thread
               or 
               another person's response.
               A general guideline for a good question or response is that 
               it should be "substantive", "interesting", and "relevant".
               Make sure to clearly explain the substance of the issue ("substantive"), 
               show us its significance ("interesting"), 
               and show us how it connects to the reading or previous discussion ("relevant"). 
               While I'm not looking for an exact word count, 
               you will need enough words to say something "substantive". 
               This will usually take at least 100 to 200 words. 
               Posts substantially below this threshold or 
               that do not extend the conversation will not receive full participation credit. 
               In other words, avoid posts that simply say "I agree with what you said" or "I like
               what you said".
               (Full credit is marked as a "93"; partial credit is marked as an "80")
               Finally, <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">discussion board posts will close at 1:40pm the day of the assigned class discussion</em>. 
               So please do not wait until the last minute. To have a vibrant discussion, 
               we will need topics and threads to be initiated before the discussion board deadline.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Quizzes (10%):</em>
               To help push you and hold you accountable for the assigned readings,
               there will be 10 quiz opportunities throughout the semester.
               Again, I know that you will sometimes have busy weeks or unexpected life events will
               arise, 
               thus you do not need to do all 12 quizzes. You are expected to complete 9 quizzes
               
               throughout the course of the semester. 
               If you do more than 9, I will count your highest 9 and drop your lowest 3.
               Quizzes will <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">only be open until 1:40pm (i.e. the start of class)</em>
               the day of the assigned class discussion. 
               After that, the quiz will close.

            <h3 id="">Argument Analyses (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Twice during the semester you will be asked to write an argument analysis based on
               our class reading. 
               This assignment will ask you to digest a difficult reading, identify the central conclusion
               of the passage, 
               and trace the key steps (or premises) of the argument leading to its conclusion.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Argument analyses should not exceed 400 words. It should be extremely difficult to
               fit
               everything within this word limit. Responses will be graded out of 20. 
               A score of 18-20 indicates that the response exceeds expectations, 
               a 16-17 meets expectations, 
               and 15 or below does not meet expectations. 
               Analyses are due via Moodle before class on the assigned due date. Late responses
               will
               not be accepted.

            <h3 id="">Movie Interpretations (22.5% each, 45%)</h3>
            
            <p>Movie interpretations are argumentative papers (3-4 pages) in which I ask you to argue
               how the
               assigned movie can be seen as an illustration of the major tenets of the philosophers
               we've studied. Your paper should begin with a thesis that declares, not merely what
               interpretation you will provide, but how you will demonstrate this interpretation.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Our first movie interpretation is based on the 1990 film <em>Lord of the
                  Flies</em>. For this interpretation, I'm asking you to explain how the movie can be
               seen as an illustration of the basic view of humanity and society laid out in the
               texts of either Thomas Hobbes or Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Our second movie interpretation is based on the 1980 Woody Allen Film <em>Crimes
                  and Misdemeanors</em>. For this interpretation I'm asking you to explain how the
               movie can be seen as illustration of the basic view of humanity, reason, or morality
               laid out by either Friedrich Nietzsche or Jean-Paul Sartre.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               A grading rubric will distributed prior to the due date of the first paper.

            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Honor Code and Plagiarism</em>: Students are expected to follow the university's honor code: 
               "The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola community have been equally
               entrusted
               by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments. Our goal
               is to
               foster a trusting atmosphere that is ideal for learning. In order to achieve this
               goal, every
               student must be actively committed to this pursuit and its responsibilities, and is
               therefore
               called to be active in the governing of the community’s standards. Thus, all students
               have the
               right, as well as the duty, to expect honest work from their colleagues. From this,
               we students
               will benefit and learn from the caring relationships that our community trustfully
               embodies.
               
               The students of this University understand that accepting collective and individual
               responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who
               submit materials that are the products of their own mind demonstrate respect for themselves
               and
               the community in which they study. These students possess a strong sense of honor,
               reverence for
               truth, and a commitment to Jesuit education. Accordingly, students found violating
               the Honor Code
               will be reprimanded appropriately in the belief that they will, with the support of
               their peers, learn
               from the mistake.
               
               This Code not only requires students to understand the ideals of truth and personal
               care as
               the two strongest educational factors expressed in cura personalis, but also calls
               them to
               demonstrate a general concern for the welfare of their colleagues and for the University."

               free from sexual and gender-based misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual
               verbal abuse, 
               sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation.
               
               Reports of such offenses are taken seriously,

               (PDF) (pages 36-37). 
               Loyola is also committed to an environment free of other forms of harassment and discrimination.

               Remember that while you have five teachers, I have more than 70 students. 
               Thus, while I'm eager to connect with you, 
               I can do this best by enforcing a few procedures. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               For questions about the course, both content and procedure questions, 
               please use our moodle help discussion board. 
               Using this system will help ensure that I see and respond to your email. 
               It will additionally ensure that others who have similar questions can also receive
               an answer. 
               
               So, if you send me a direct email about course content and procedure, 
               I will politely ask you to ask it again via our moodle "help" discussion board 
               and I will be eager and glad to respond.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               For other issues, I will be glad to discuss these with you.
               But I would ask that you try to use our office hours booking service 
               and reserve a time slot to discuss it with me. 
               We can generally always communicate better when we speak in person 
               and this is an opportunity for me to get to know you better. 
               This also helps me manage my time and provide you with the best response I can.
               
               So again, if you send me a direct email, I'll will be glad to discuss it with you,
               
               but I will often direct you to the booking system 
               so that we can schedule a chance to talk about the issue.
