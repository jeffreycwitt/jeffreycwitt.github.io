         <p>Centered around close readings of the legal and political writings of Thomas Aquinas
            and Thomas Hobbes, 
            this course will introduce students to the basic concepts proper  
            to the philosophy of law. It will also introduce students to the momentous shift that
            occurs in political philosophy between the medieval and early modern period.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Seminar discussions will pay special attention to the moral, political, and theological
            foundations of obligation and law 
            as they arise in our readings. Our concern for the foundations of law will also prompt
            us to consider the way ideas 
            about individual happiness and the common good influence ideas about the purpose of
            law and, in turn, ideas about 
            the nature of property, the legitimacy of war, the value of civil disobedience, and
            the proper interaction 
            between religious and secular law, church and state.

            <h3 id="">In-Class Participation (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>Be a present and <em>active</em> participant in seminar discussions. The primary goal of a seminar course is not to
               come together to merely survey or review the contents of the required readings. On
               the contrary, class time is an opportunity for us to engage in a critical discussion
               and to evaluate the merits and implications of the days reading. To that end, I expect
               that you come to the class after both reading and preparing notes (comments, questions,
               concerns) about the text that you can share during the seminar. Reading with a pencil
               and notebook in hand is a great practice for reading difficult texts and should become
               your regular habit. Outline the text as you read, marking questions and concerns as
               you go. Then, always bring your text and your notes to class. In short, during our
               time together, I expect to be able to ask you not merely what the day's reading said,
               but about your reactions to the argument of the text. What were you concerns about
               the argument? What questions do you have about what the author said? What do you think
               the implications of the argument are?

            <p>To aid our preparation and participation, I have created a <a href="http://lawsocietygod.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">class wiki [http://lawsocietygod.wikispaces.com]</a> in which I'm asking you to participate in two ways.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>1) Regularly (at least once a week) [1] post a question or comment and [2] respond
               to a post or comment on the reading discussion page. All other creative and thoughtful
               contributions to the wiki are welcome, i.e. links to related readings, videos or podcasts,
               or even additional guided reading questions. (I will print out a user report at the
               end of the week and record participation.) (10%)
            </p>  
            
            
            <p>2) Prepare and post a "chapter review article" for four of our readings throughout
               the semester. A sign-up sheet will be distributed in advance. Two of these chapter
               article reviews should be done with a partner and two should be done individually
               (20%).

                  distributed in advance. On the day of the exam two questions will be selected at random.
                  Students will have the class period to write their answers.

                  from Aquinas and Hobbes as well as our class discussion of these texts. A list of
                  possible essay questions will be distributed in advance and two exam questions will
                  be selected from this list on the day of the final. Students will have the exam period

            <h3 id="">Research Paper (30%)</h3>
            
            
            <p>8-10 page research paper in response to the following prompt:</p> 
            
            <p><em>Identify a critical problem or question within the philosophy of law, and then compare,
                  contrast, and evaluate the respective positions of Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Hobbes.</em></p>
            
            
            <p>In this prompt there are three major things I'm asking you to do.</p> 
            
            
            <p>The first thing I am asking you to do is to identify an enduring problem or question
               within the philosophy of law. To do this you will need to do more than just declare
               and assert that something is a topic of interest. You need to demonstrate why this
               topic or question is a perennial difficulty. In other words, you need to demonstrate
               to your reader that this question is both difficult to answer and has important implications.
               Demonstration of this topic's importance will require engagement with secondary sources.
               I will be looking for a sophisticated use of secondary sources that assist you in
               the clarification of terms and in the demonstration of the difficulty you assert.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The second thing I am asking you to do is provide an accurate and insightful comparison
               of the positions of Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Hobbes on the topic or problem chosen.
               I expect to see sophisticated textual support here. Key quotations should be both
               introduced and explained.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Finally, I'm looking for a thoughtful evaluation of the two positions. An evaluation
               can vary in kind. It can assert the superiority of one position over another or it
               can assert the adequacy or inadequacy of both positions with respect to the stated
               problem. But the important synthesis I'm looking for is an argument for why your evaluation
               is plausible. In short, in light of the question or concern posed at the outset, your
               argument needs to show how the positions of Aquinas and Hobbes fair and most importantly
               why. Strategic use of both primary and secondary sources is expected here.
