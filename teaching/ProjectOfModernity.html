         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p>The Project of Modernity is a survey course designed to introduce students to some
            of
            the most important developments in the history of modern philosophy. In particular,
            this
            course aims to introduce students to the development of a web of issues surrounding
            the
            human person, reason, freedom, and the good life. Students will be asked to absorb
            modern philosophy’s long preoccupation with these issues, recognize the perennial
            difficulties that arise, and actively reflect on the consequences of their own
            views.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major philosophers
            and their distinctive positions from the early modern to contemporary period. Be able
            to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied. Assignments: lectures,
            readings, reading reflection responses, exams.
         </p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase student's ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in class.
            Assignments: class discussions, movie interpretations, exams.
         </p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of justice, happiness, moral conduct, and the life they want to
            live.
            Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation, i.e. develop an appetite
            for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize the difference between
            this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to describe the consequences
            and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's own life and decisions: especially,
            the impact on what one values, how one thinks about injustice, freedom, and cooperation,
            and how one conceives of the good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (15%)</h3>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">In-class involvement (5%):</em> In-class involvement is a small part
               of your grade that typically makes a big difference. Class involvement means, first
               of
               all, coming to class. Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. This primarily
               means both having read the assigned text and having the day's reading out and ready
               to
               be marked. Thirdly, it means being an active participant in the classroom. At times
               we
               will have opportunities for discussion; someone who is involved in class will be a
               thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion. At other times, lectures will
               solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student will bring up helpful and
               appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input
               is
               called upon.
            </p>
            
            <p>To encourage you in the above three areas. I will keep attendance throughout the
               course. Because I know that things come up, people get sick, and emergencies happen,
               I
               will overlook your first two absences (excused or otherwise). After two absences,
               every absence will reduce your participation grade by half. Since our class is
               primarily devoted to the reading of texts, it is imperative that you have your text
               (including assigned PDFs available on Moodle) with you in class in a printed form
               that
               you can mark up and take notes on. Accordingly, not having the assigned reading with
               you will count as not being present. The use of cell phones in class for texting or
               any other reason will result in an automatic 0 for this portion of your grade. (Do
               yourself a favor and put your cell phones away and out of sight for the duration of
               our class.)
            </p>
            
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Reflection Responses (10%):</em> Good philosophical reading
               depends on sustained reflection on the arguments you read. It helps you lock in what
               you've read and really push yourself to consider the consequences of the position
               in
               question. It is a great practice to adopt after every reading. In order to help you
               develop this habit, I ask that you post a reading reflection response on Moodle in
               eight 
               different weeks throughout the semester. 
               Note that for a response to count for a given week, it must be more than 200 words
               and it must 
               be posted prior to our class discussion of the relevant material.

            <h3 id="">Movie Interpretations (22.5% each, 45%)</h3>
            
            <p>Movie interpretations are argumentative papers (3-4) in which I ask you to argue how
               the
               assigned movie can be seen as an illustration of the major tenets of the philosophers
               we've studied. Your paper should begin with a thesis that declares, not merely what
               interpretation you will provide, but how you will demonstrate this interpretation
               (i.e. it should indicate what aspect of the film is the decisive piece of evidence
               for
               your interpretation and why).
            </p>
            
            <p>Our first movie interpretation is based on the 1990 film <em>Lord of the
                  Flies</em>. For this interpretation, I'm asking you to explain how the movie can be
               seen as an illustration of the basic view of humanity and society laid out in the
               texts of either Thomas Hobbes or Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Our second movie interpretation is based on the 1980 Woody Allen Film <em>Crimes
                  and Misdemeanors</em>. For this interpretation I'm asking you to explain how the
               movie can be seen as illustration of the basic view of humanity, reason, or morality
               laid out by either Friedrich Nietzsche or Jean-Paul Sartre.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>A grading rubric will distributed prior to the due date of the first paper.</p>

            <h3 id="">Quizzes (5% each, 15%)</h3>
            
            <p>To keep you motivated in your reading 
               and preparation, we will have three quizzes throughout the semester.

            <h3 id="">Final Exam (25%)</h3>
            
            <p>The cumulative final exam will include multiple choice questions, quotation
               identifications, short answer questions, and an essay question focusing on core
               concepts and problems discussed during the course of the semester.

            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Honor Code and Plagiarism</em>: Students are expected to follow the university's honor code: 
               "The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola community have been equally
               entrusted
               by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments. Our goal
               is to
               foster a trusting atmosphere that is ideal for learning. In order to achieve this
               goal, every
               student must be actively committed to this pursuit and its responsibilities, and is
               therefore
               called to be active in the governing of the community’s standards. Thus, all students
               have the
               right, as well as the duty, to expect honest work from their colleagues. From this,
               we students
               will benefit and learn from the caring relationships that our community trustfully
               embodies.
               
               The students of this University understand that accepting collective and individual
               responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who
               submit materials that are the products of their own mind demonstrate respect for themselves
               and
               the community in which they study. These students possess a strong sense of honor,
               reverence for
               truth, and a commitment to Jesuit education. Accordingly, students found violating
               the Honor Code
               will be reprimanded appropriately in the belief that they will, with the support of
               their peers, learn
               from the mistake.
               
               This Code not only requires students to understand the ideals of truth and personal
               care as
               the two strongest educational factors expressed in cura personalis, but also calls
               them to
               demonstrate a general concern for the welfare of their colleagues and for the University."

               <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Title IX</em> Loyola University Maryland is committed to a learning and working environment 
               free from sexual and gender-based misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual
               verbal abuse, 
               sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation.
               
               Reports of such offenses are taken seriously, 
               and Loyola encourages students experiencing sexual misconduct 
               to report the incident in accordance with the University’s policy on Reporting Misconduct
               (PDF) (pages 36-37). 
               Loyola is also committed to an environment free of other forms of harassment and discrimination.

            <h3 id="">Computer, Cell Phones and Email Policy</h3>
            
            <p>I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class. They are almost
               always a distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special
               reason that you need a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work
               something out.) Students using cell phones in any capacity will find their
               participation grade negatively affected. If you find this policy frustrating, then
               I
               encourage you to watch the Frontline documentary: Digital Nation 
               <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" target="_blank">

               in
               during class. If, for some reason, this is not possible, a hard copy in my mailbox
               is
               the next best option. Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me
               about emergencies, but, about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to
               face. This is what office hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office
               hours conflict with your schedule, I will be glad to work with you to find a time
               that
               does fit.
