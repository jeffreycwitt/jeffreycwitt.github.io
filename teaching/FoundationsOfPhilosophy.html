         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p><em>Foundations of Philosophy</em> is a general introduction to the basic
            problems of philosophy and the classical sources that first recognized and then
            formulated these problems. The objectives of the course are two-fold. The first is
            to
            introduce students to the early history of philosophy. Second, within this general
            historical context, the course will focus on the development of the three problem
            areas
            that have come to define the field of philosophy today: epistemology, metaphysics,
            and
            ethics. Students will be asked to absorb philosophyâ€™s long preoccupation with these
            issues, recognize the perennial difficulties that arise, and actively reflect on the
            consequences of positions taken.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major foundational
            philosophers and their distinctive positions in the core problem areas (epistemology,
            metaphysics, and ethics). Be able to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.
         </p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase students' ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in
            class.
         </p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of knowledge, existence, justice, happiness, and ultimately the
            life
            they want to live. Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation,
            i.e.
            develop an appetite for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize
            the
            difference between this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to
            describe the consequences and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's own
            life
            and decisions: especially, the impact on what one values and how one conceives of
            the
            good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (22.5%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               In-Class Participation (2.5%): Class involvement is a small part of your grade that
               typically makes a big difference. 
               Class involvement means, first of all, coming to class. 
               Missing three or more classes will result in an automatic 
               zero for your participation grade. 
               Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. 
               However, preparation needs to bear fruit in the classroom. 
               In other words, you need to strive to be an asset to the class. 
               At times we will have opportunities for discussion; 
               someone who is involved in class will be a thoughtful and engaged participant in that
               discussion. 
               At other times, lectures will solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student
               will bring up helpful 
               and appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input
               is called upon. 
               (Use of cell phones in class for texting or any other reason will result in an automatic
               0 for this portion of your grade. 
               Do yourself a favor and put your cell phones away and out sight for the duration of
               our class.)
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               A critical part of this course is learning how to read and absorb difficult philosophical
               material. 
               Learning this skill that you learn to read in a participatory and active way. 
               First and foremost, you cannot acquire this skill without actually reading. 
               But secondly, you need to read in a different way than you might read a novel. 
               You need to read actively. This means annotating your text with pencil as you go,
               
               and then responding to what you've read, so that you can internalize it, 
               rather than allowing it to pass through you. 
               Our participation grade is designed to push you towards this kind of reading.
               With nearly every reading assignment (preceding our class discussion) there is an
               opportunity to respond, 
               either through a reading quiz, a class discussion forum, or worksheet.
               These assignments are intended to be completed BEFORE our class meeting on the assigned
               day. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Reading Quizzes (10%): there will be 10 quiz opportunities through the semester. 
               I know that you will sometimes have busy weeks or unexpected life events will arise,
               
               thus you do not need to do all 10 quizzes. You are expected to complete 8 quizzes
               
               throughout the course of the semester. 
               If you do more than 8, I will count your highest 8 and drop your lowest 2.
               Quizzes will only be open from 12pm the day before the assigned class 
               and close when the class begins.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Class Discussions (7.5%): 
               There will be approximately 17 available class forum discussions. 
               Again, because I know you will have busy weeks, 
               you do not need to participate in each discussion. But through the course of the semester,
               
               You need to participate in 8 discussions. 
               (But as the goal of this assignment is to help digest and actively respond to our
               reading, 
               you are encouraged to participate in any and all discussion forums).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               What does a full credit discussion forum participation look like? 
               To get credit you need to participate at least twice in any given discussion, 
               either by introducing a new topic/thread posing a question for the class
               or responding to a peer's original post or another response. 
               To encourage interaction, discussion board's will be limited to 3 topic threads; 
               after 3 threads have been initiated, you can then only respond to a thread 
               respond to another person's response.
               
               A general guideline for a good question or response is that 
               it should be "substantive" "interesting" and "relevant".
               
               Make sure to clearly explain the substance of the issue ("substantive"), show us its
               significance ("interesting"), 
               and show us how it connects to the reading or previous discussion ("relevant"). 
               
               Again, discussion boards will close at the time that the associated class begins.
               
               So please do not wait until the last minute. To have a vibrant discussion, 
               we will need topics and threads to be initiated before the discussion board deadline.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Other Participation Activities (2.5%): Beyond quizzes and discussion boards, 
               we will have a few worksheets that I will ask you to turn in. 
               These will count toward your participation grade.

            <h3 id="">Argument Analyses (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Twice during the semester you will be asked to write an argument analysis based on
               our class reading. 
               This assignment will ask you to digest a difficult reading, identify the central claim
               of the passage, 
               and trace the key steps of the argument leading to its conclusion.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Argument analyses should not exceed 400 words. It should be extremely difficult to
               fit
               everything within this word limit. Responses will be graded out of 20. 
               A score of 18-20 indicates that the response exceeds expectations, 
               a 16-17 meets expectations, 
               and 15 or below does not meet expectations. 
               Analyses are due in class on the assigned due date. Late responses will
               not be accepted.

            <p>Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of epistemology,
               basic logic, and common logical fallacies.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 2 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics.
               It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed by the
               early presocratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle responded
               to these problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>Final Exam (22.5%): The cumulative final exam will include short fact based

               semester.

            can approve the exception). 
            Students using cell phones during class will find their participation grade negatively
