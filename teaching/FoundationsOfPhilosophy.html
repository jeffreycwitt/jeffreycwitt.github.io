         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p><em>Foundations of Philosophy</em> is a general introduction to the basic
            problems of philosophy and the classical sources that first recognized and then
            formulated these problems. The objectives of the course are two-fold. The first is
            to
            introduce students to the early history of philosophy. Second, within this general
            historical context, the course will focus on the development of the three problem
            areas
            that have come to define the field of philosophy today: epistemology, metaphysics,
            and
            ethics. Students will be asked to absorb philosophyâ€™s long preoccupation with these
            issues, recognize the perennial difficulties that arise, and actively reflect on the
            consequences of positions taken.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major foundational
            philosophers and their distinctive positions in the core problem areas. Be able to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.
         </p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase students' ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in
            class.
         </p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of knowledge, existence, justice, happiness, and ultimately the
            life
            they want to live. Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation,
            i.e.
            develop an appetite for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize
            the
            difference between this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to
            describe the consequences and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's own
            life
            and decisions: especially, the impact on what one values and how one conceives of
            the
            good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (15%)</h3>
            
            
            <p>In-Class Participation (5%): Class involvement is a small part of your grade that
               typically makes a big difference. Class involvement means, first of all, coming to
               class. Missing three or more classes will result in an automatic zero for your
               participation grade. Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. However, preparation
               needs to bear fruit in the classroom. In other words, you need to strive to be an
               asset to the class. At times we will have opportunities for discussion; someone who
               is
               involved in class will be a thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion.
               At
               other times, lectures will solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student
               will bring up helpful and appropriate questions and be able to make a positive
               contribution when class input is called upon. Finally, we will occasionally have
               low-stakes writing and worksheet assignments, which you will be expected to give your
               best effort and hand in. (Use of cell phones in class for texting or any other reason
               will result in an automatic 0 for this portion of your grade. Do yourself a favor
               and
               put your cell phones away and out sight for the duration of our class.)
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Reading Response Participation (10%): 
               For each class reading, I will post a set of guided reading questions on moodle to
               help 
               guide you through our sometimes very difficult reading. Included at the bottom of
               these 
               reading questions will be one or two reflection questions. 
               While you ARE expected to look over the guided reading and reflection 
               questions for each reading as you prepare for class, 
               you are NOT required to submit a written answer for every reflection question. 
               Rather, I ask that you respond to 8 different reflection prompts 
               for readings in 8 different weeks throughout the semester.
               Responses should be submitted via the Moodle reading discussion board 
               prior to the class meeting for which the reading is assigned.
               Only one response per week will be counted.
            </p>

         <div>
            
            <h3 id="">Argument Analyses (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Twice during the semester you will be asked to write an argument analysis based on
               our class reading. 
               This assignment will ask you to digest a difficult reading, identify the central claim
               of the passage, 
               and trace the key steps of the argument leading to its conclusion.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Argument analyses should not exceed 400 words. It should be extremely difficult to
               fit
               everything within this word limit. Responses will be graded out of 20. 
               A score of 18-20 indicates that the response exceeds expectations, 
               a 16-17 meets expectations, 
               and 15 or below does not meet expectations. 
               Analyses are due in class on the assigned due date. Late responses will
               not be accepted.

            <h3 id="">Exams (70%)</h3>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problem of epistemology,
               basic logic, and common logical fallacies.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 2 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics.
               It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed by the
               early presocratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle responded
               to these problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>Final Exam (30%): The cumulative final exam will include short fact based
               questions, quotation identification, and essay responses 
               on core concepts and problems discussed during the course of the
               semester.

         <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
         
         
         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The
            Students of this University understand that having collective and individual
            responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to
            the
            community. Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds
            demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside
            resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt or
            question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor Code
            will
            be handled by the Honor Council."

         <p>
            I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class. 
            They are almost always a distraction. 
            (If there is a special reason that you need a computer, 
            please let me know, and we can most likely work
            something out.) Students using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation
            grade negatively affected. If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you
            to
            watch the Frontline documentary: Digital Nation 
            <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid</a>.

         <p>Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me about emergencies, but
            about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to face. This is what office
            hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office hours conflict with your
            schedule, I will be glad to work with you to find a time that does fit.
