         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p>
            A one semester introduction to philosophy. 
            Three focal points are covered: the emergence and development 
            of rational theories on the nature of reality (metaphysics); 
            questions concerning the grounds for distinguishing 
            between knowledge and opinion (epistemology); 
            and the nature and status of values (ethical, aesthetic, religious, etc.). 
            Special attention is paid to the origins of philosophy 
            and its historical beginnings in the ancient world.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major foundational
            philosophers and their distinctive positions in the core problem areas (epistemology,
            metaphysics, and ethics). Be able to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.</p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase students' ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in
            class.</p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of knowledge, existence, justice, happiness, and ultimately the
            life
            they want to live. Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation,
            i.e.
            develop an appetite for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize
            the
            difference between this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to
            describe the consequences and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's own
            life
            and decisions: especially, the impact on what one values and how one conceives of
            the
            good life.</p>

            <h3 id="">Participation (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               In-Class Participation (2.5%): Class involvement is a small part of your grade that
               typically makes a big difference. 
               Class involvement means, first of all, coming to class. This also means always having
               your course packet or course reading with you. 
               (Not having your course materials is like coming to soccer practice without your cleats
               or a ball.)
               Missing three or more classes will result in an automatic zero for your in-class participation
               grade. 
               Missing more than 6 classes will be grounds for failing the course.
               Secondly, it means coming to class prepared, and preparation needs to bear fruit in
               the classroom. 
               In other words, you need to strive to be an asset to the class. 
               At times we will have opportunities for discussion; 
               someone who is involved in class will be a thoughtful and engaged participant in that
               discussion. 
               At other times, lectures will solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student
               will bring up helpful 
               and appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input
               is called upon. 
               (Using cell phones or laptops in class, unless as an approved DSS accommodation or
               otherwise directed by the instructor, 
               will result in an automatic 0 for this portion of your grade. See "Computers and Cell
               Phones" policy below. 
               Do yourself a favor and put your laptops and cell phones away and out sight for the
               duration of our class.)
               </p>
            
            <p>
               Reading Quizzes/Responses (5%): Approximately once a week we will have reading quizzes
               and/or responses. 
               These are low-stakes quizzes or in-class writing responses designed to motivate you
               too keep up with the reading and stay engaged with the course. 
               There will be 8-12 of these quizzes throughout the semester. Because I know that everyone
               has busy weeks or has to miss a class, I will drop your lowest two quizzes. 
               (Note: Quizzes cannot be made up, but that's why I drop your lowest two quizzes. If
               you have to miss a class in which a quiz was given, don't worry; 
               that will just be one of your dropped quizzes.)
               </p>
            
            <p>
               Participation Worksheets (7.5%): At various times (especially during our logic unit)
               you will be asked to turn in worksheets as homework before the assigned class.
               </p>

            <h3 id="">Argument Analyses (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Two times throughout the semester you will be asked to write a short "argument analysis."
               This assignment is designed to help you develop the skill of tracing complicated arguments
               
               and communicating those arguments to others. 
               Specific assignment instructions will be distributed in advance of each due date.
               </p>
            
            <p>
               Responses will be graded out of 100. 
               A score of 90-100 indicates that the response exceeds expectations, 
               a 80-89 meets expectations, 
               and 79 or below does not meet expectations. 
               Analyses are due via Moodle on the assigned due date. Late responses will
               not be accepted.

            <p>Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of epistemology,
               basic logic, and common logical fallacies.</p>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 2 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics.
               It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed by the
               early pre-socratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle responded
               to these problems.</p>
            
            <p>Final Exam (30%): The longer, cumulative final exam will include short fact based
               questions, quotation identification, argument analysis, and essay responses 
               on core concepts and problems discussed during the course of the
               semester.</p>

            I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class, unless I invite

            Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me about emergencies, but

            I prefer to meet with you face to face. 
            This is what office hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office hours
            
            conflict with your schedule, I will be glad to work with you to find a time that does
            fit.

         <h2 id="">Honor Code and Plagiarism</h2>
         
         <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
         
         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The
            Students of this University understand that having collective and individual
            responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to
            the
            community. Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds
            demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside
            resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt or
            question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor Code
            will
            be handled by the Honor Council."
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Statement on Generative-AI: This course focuses on skill building in the areas of
            close reading, 
            argument analysis, and argument construction. As such (and as stated in the above
            honor code) 
            it is expected that in this course your compositions are self-generated. 
            While there are many legitimate reasons to use and value generative-AI tools, 
            the goal of this class is to cultivate the very analytical skills that are needed
            to use AI tools well. 
            Therefore outsourcing our class exercises, just as outsourcing drills in athletics,
            defeats the purpose.
            Thus, in this class, the above Honor Code includes the expectation 
            that your submitted responses and compositions are always self-generated.
            </p>
