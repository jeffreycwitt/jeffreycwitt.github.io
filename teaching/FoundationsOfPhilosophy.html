         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         					
         <p><em>Foundations of Philosophy</em> is a general introduction to the basic
            						problems of philosophy and the classical sources that first recognized and then
            						formulated these problems. The objectives of the course are two-fold. The first
            is to
            						introduce students to the early history of philosophy. Second, within this general
            						historical context, the course will focus on the development of the three problem
            areas
            						that have come to define the field of philosophy today: epistemology, metaphysics,
            and
            						ethics. Students will be asked to absorb philosophyâ€™s long preoccupation with
            these
            						issues, recognize the perennial difficulties that arise, and actively reflect
            on the
            						consequences of positions taken.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         					
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            						of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major foundational
            						philosophers and their distinctive positions in the core problem areas. Be able
            to
            						compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.
         </p>
         					
         <p>2) Aims: Increase student's ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            						philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to
            oneself
            						and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points.
            Be able to
            						articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed
            in
            						class.
         </p>
         					
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            						through the nature of knowledge, existence, justice, happiness, and ultimately
            the life
            						they want to live. Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation,
            i.e.
            						develop an appetite for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize
            the
            						difference between this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able
            to
            						describe the consequences and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's
            own life
            						and decisions: especially, the impact on what one values and how one conceives
            of the
            						good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (15%)</h3>
            
            						
            <p>In-Class Participation (5%): Class involvement is a small part of your grade that
               							typically makes a big difference. Class involvement means, first of all, coming
               to
               							class. Missing three or more classes will result in an automatic zero for your
               							participation grade. This includes Messina enrichment hours. 
               							Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. However, preparation
               							needs to bear fruit in the classroom. In other words, you need to strive to
               be an
               							asset to the class. At times we will have opportunities for discussion; someone
               who is
               							involved in class will be a thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion.
               At
               							other times, lectures will solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged
               student
               							will bring up helpful and appropriate questions and be able to make a positive
               							contribution when class input is called upon. Finally, we will occasionally
               have
               							low-stakes writing and worksheet assignments, which you will be expected to
               give your
               							best effort and hand in. (Use of cell phones in class for texting or any other
               reason
               							will result in an automatic 0 for this portion of your grade. Do yourself a
               favor and
               							put your cell phones away and out sight for the duration of our class.)
            </p>
            
            						
            						
            <p>Reading Response Participation (10%): 
               							For each class reading, I will be handing out a set of guided reading questions
               to help 
               							guide you through our sometimes very difficult reading. Included at the bottom
               of these 
               							reading questions will be one or two reflection questions. 
               							While you are expected to look over the guided reading questions for each reading
               as you prepare for class, 
               							you are NOT required to submit a written answer for every reflection question.
               
               							Rather, I ask that you respond to 8 different prompts for readings in 8 different
               weeks throughout the semester. 
               							In order to count, responses must be turned in at the beginning of the class
               
               							in which the text in question is discussed. I will accept only one response
               per week.
            </p>
            						
            						
            <p>In addition to your reading responses, there will be two Messina events, a lecture
               event and trip to the Symphony, for 
               							which I will ask a similar reflection. These responses are due at the class
               that follows the event.
            </p>
            						
            						
            <p>All responses should be at least 250 words but can be as long as you want. They should
               show evidence that you have 
               							read the text and made a serious attempt to reflect on the prompt.
            </p>

            <h3 id="">Critical Evaluation (20%)</h3>
            						
            <p>Evaluations are an opportunity to critically evaluate the pros and cons of an idea
               							that has come up in our readings or discussions. Throughout the semester there
               will be
               							four evaluation opportunities. Each evaluation should focus on a topic that
               emerged
               							between the due date of the previous evaluation and the due date of the current
               							evaluation.
            </p>
            
            						
            <p>The expectations for evaluations follow from the outcome they are attempting to
               							achieve. Philosophical activity begins in wonder or puzzlement. Likewise, a
               philosophy
               							paper typically begins with an intriguing question. But what distinguishes
               an
               							interesting from a boring question? A true puzzle is found where conflicting
               answers
               							for a problem can be supported. The goal of critical evaluations is for you
               to
               							recognize a problem and to articulate it for yourself. A strong evaluation
               will [1]
               							begin with a statement or thesis that quickly identifies a position or idea
               from the
               							week's reading and summarizes the dilemma you will describe below. The evaluation
               will
               							then [2] articulate accurately the reason or reasons in support of the proposed
               idea.
               							[3] Finally, it will describe a difficulty that such a position (or its consequences)
               							faces: perhaps the idea challenges or conflicts with another commonly held
               belief.
               							Perhaps the idea seems to contradict a familiar experience or unexamined assumption,
               							or perhaps the argument commits a fallacy of some sort. In your evaluations,
               please
               							avoid using the first person pronoun ("I", "me", etc.). Articulate your evaluation
               in
               							such a way as to convey to your reader that this is a universal puzzle that
               everyone
               							should be able to recognize and is not simply a personal problem unique to
               your own
               							mental state. (A few examples will be distributed before the first evaluation
               is
               							due.)
            </p>
            
            						
            <p>Critical Evaluations should be 400 words. It should be extremely difficult to fit
               							everything within this word limit. Responses will be graded out of 20. I will
               be
               							looking for the three elements described above. A score of 18-20 indicates
               that the
               							response exceeds expectations, a 16-17 meets expectations, and 15 or below
               does not
               							meet expectations. Please write your name, date, and word count on the top
               of your
               							response. Evaluations are due in class on the assigned due date. Late responses
               will
               							not be accepted.

            <h3 id="">Exams (65%)</h3>
            						
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): A short exam focused on the central problem of epistemology,
               							basic logic, and common logical fallacies.
            </p>
            						
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 2 (22.5%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics.
               							It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed
               by the
               							early presocratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle
               responded
               							to these problems.
            </p>
            						
            <p>Final Exam (22.5%): The cumulative final exam will include short fact based
               							questions, quotation identification, and essay responses 
               							on core concepts and problems discussed during the course of the
               							semester.

         <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
         
         					
         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            						entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The
            						Students of this University understand that having collective and individual
            						responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment
            to the
            						community. Students who submit materials that are the products of their own
            minds
            						demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All
            outside
            						resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt
            or
            						question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            						assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor
            Code will
            						be handled by the Honor Council."

         <p>Issues of plagiarism and cheating will be dealt with in accordance with the philosophy

         <h2 id="">Computer, Cell Phones and Email Policy</h2>
         					
         <p>I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class. They are almost
            						always a distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is
            a special
            						reason that you need a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work
            						something out.) Students using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation
            						grade negatively affected. If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage
            you to
            						watch the Frontline documentary: Digital Nation 
            						<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid</a>.

         <p>Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me about emergencies, but
            						about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to face. This is what
            office
            						hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office hours conflict with
            your
