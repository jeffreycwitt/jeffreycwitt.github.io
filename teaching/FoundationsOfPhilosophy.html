         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p><em>Foundations of Philosophy</em> is a general introduction to the basic
            problems of philosophy and the classical sources that first recognized and then
            formulated these problems. The objectives of the course are two-fold. The first is
            to
            introduce students to the early history of philosophy. Second, within this general
            historical context, the course will focus on the development of the three problem
            areas
            that have come to define the field of philosophy today: epistemology, metaphysics,
            and
            ethics. Students will be asked to absorb philosophyâ€™s long preoccupation with these
            issues, recognize the perennial difficulties that arise, and actively reflect on the
            consequences of positions taken.

         <h2 id="">Course Learning Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
         
         <p>1) Aims: Exposure to and increased facility in comprehension of the foundational texts
            of philosophy. Outcomes: Be able to identify (chronologically) the major foundational
            philosophers and their distinctive positions in the core problem areas. Be able to
            compare and contrast the positions of philosophers studied.
         </p>
         
         <p>2) Aims: Increase students' ability to recognize and appreciate the complexity of
            core
            philosophical problems. Develop a mind that can articulate that complexity to oneself
            and others. Outcomes: Be able to see a problem from diverse vantage points. Be able
            to
            articulate both the pros and cons of perennial philosophical issues discussed in
            class.
         </p>
         
         <p>3) Aims: Help students to question the values they take for granted and to think
            through the nature of knowledge, existence, justice, happiness, and ultimately the
            life
            they want to live. Help students cultivate a taste for philosophical speculation,
            i.e.
            develop an appetite for "contemplation with friends" and a palate that can recognize
            the
            difference between this kind of enjoyment and alternatives. Outcomes: Be able to
            describe the consequences and impact of a given philosophical stance for one's own
            life
            and decisions: especially, the impact on what one values and how one conceives of
            the
            good life.

            <h3 id="">Participation (22.5%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               A critical part of this course is learning how to read and absorb difficult philosophical
               material. 
               Learning this skill that you learn to read in a participatory and active way. 
               First and foremost, you cannot acquire this skill without actually reading. 
               But secondly, you need to read in a different way than you might read a novel. 
               You need to read actively. This means annotating your text with pencil as you go,
               
               and then responding to what you've read, so that you can internalize it, 
               rather than allowing it to pass through you. 
               Our participation grade is designed to push you towards this kind of reading.
               With nearly every reading assignment (preceding our class discussion) there is an
               opportunity to respond, 
               either through a reading quiz, a class discussion forum, or worksheet.
               These assignments are intended to be completed BEFORE our class meeting on the assigned
               day. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Reading Quizzes (10%): there will be 10 quiz opportunities through the semester. 
               I know that you will sometimes have busy weeks or unexpected life events will arise,
               
               thus you do not need to do all 10 quizzes. You are expected to complete 8 quizzes
               
               throughout the course of the semester. 
               If you do more than 8, I will count your highest 8 and drop your lowest 2.
               Quizzes will only be open until 12pm the day of the assigned class discussion. 
               After that, the quiz will close.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Class Discussions (10%): 
               There will be approximately 18 available class forum discussions. 
               Again, because I know you will have busy weeks, 
               you do not need to participate in each discussion. But through the course of the semester,
               
               You need to participate in 8 discussions. 
               (But as the goal of this assignment is to help digest and actively respond to our
               reading, 
               you are encouraged to participate in any and all discussion forums).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               What does a full credit discussion forum participation look like? 
               To get credit you need to participate at least twice in any given discussion, 
               either by introducing a new topic/thread posing a question for the class
               or responding to a peer's original post or another response. 
               To encourage interaction, discussion board's will be limited to 3 topic threads; 
               after 3 threads have been initiated, you can then only respond to a thread 
               respond to another person's response.
               
               A general guideline for a good question or response is that 
               it should be "substantive" "interesting" and "relevant".
               
               Make sure to clearly explain the substance of the issue ("substantive"), show us its
               significance ("interesting"), 
               and show us how it connects to the reading or previous discussion ("relevant"). 
               
               Again, discussion board will close at 12pm the day of the assigned class discussion.
               
               So please do not wait until the last minute. To have a vibrant discussion, 
               we will need topics and threads to be initiated before the discussion board deadline.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Other Participation Activities (2.5%): Beyond quizzes and discussion boards, 
               we will have a few worksheets that I will ask you to turn in. 
               These will count toward your participation grade. 
            </p>

         <div>
            
            <h3 id="">Argument Analyses (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Twice during the semester you will be asked to write an argument analysis based on
               our class reading. 
               This assignment will ask you to digest a difficult reading, identify the central claim
               of the passage, 
               and trace the key steps of the argument leading to its conclusion.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Argument analyses should not exceed 400 words. It should be extremely difficult to
               fit
               everything within this word limit. Responses will be graded out of 20. 
               A score of 18-20 indicates that the response exceeds expectations, 
               a 16-17 meets expectations, 
               and 15 or below does not meet expectations. 
               Analyses are due in class on the assigned due date. Late responses will
               not be accepted.

            <h3 id="">Exams (62.5%)</h3>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 1 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of epistemology,
               basic logic, and common logical fallacies.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mid-Term Exam 2 (20%): This exam will focus on the central problems of metaphysics.
               It will expect that you can articulate the basic metaphysical problems posed by the
               early presocratic thinkers and can generally explain how Plato and Aristotle responded
               to these problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>Final Exam (22.5%): The cumulative final exam will include short fact based
               questions, quotation identification, and essay responses 
               on core concepts and problems discussed during the course of the
               semester.

         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The

            responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to
            the

            demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside
            resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt or
            question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor Code
            will

         <p>
            Remember that while you have five teachers, I have more than 70 students. 
            Thus, while I'm eager to connect with you, 
            I can do this best by enforcing a few procedure. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            For questions about the course, both content and procedure questions, 
            please use our moodle help discussion board. 
            Using this system will help ensure that I see and respond to your email. 
            It will additionally ensure that others who have similar questions can also receive
            an answer. 
            
            So, if you send me a direct email about course content and procedure, 
            I will politely ask you to ask it via our moodle "help" discussion board 
            and I will be eager and glad to respond.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            For other issues, I will be glad to discuss these with you.
            But I would ask that you try to use our booking service 
            and reserve a time slot to discuss it with me. 
            We can generally always communicate better when we speak in person 
            and this is an opportunity for me to get to know you better. 
            This also helps me manage my time and provide you with the best response I can.
            
            So again, if you send me a direct email, I'll will be glad to discuss it with you,
            
            but I will often direct you to the booking system 
            so that we can schedule a chance to talk about the issue.

         <h2 id="">Zoom Participation and Zoom Recording Policy</h2>
         
         <p>The expectation is that video is on, unless there is a reason for it not to be on,
            such as poor internet connectivity or student concerns about privacy in a shared living
            or work environment. 
            If there are valid reasons why someone may not be able to participate via video and
            sound during our Zoom discussion period, please schedule any appointment with me to
            discuss alternative ways of ensuring attendance and participation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Class sessions conducted via Zoom may be visually and audio-recorded for later reference
            by students and approved faculty and staff associated with the class (e.g., Messina
            instructors and administrator).  Students who participate with their video-feeds activated
            or use a personal image on their Zoom profile acknowledge and agree that their videos
            and/or profile images will be recorded.  If you do not wish to have your video and/or
            profile image recorded, ensure that your camera is turned off and do not use a personal
            image on your Zoom profile.  Likewise, any students who un-mute their audio during
            class and participate orally in class agree to have their voices recorded.  If you
            do not wish to have your voice recorded in a class recording, ensure that you have
            muted your Zoom audio prior to the beginning of class.
