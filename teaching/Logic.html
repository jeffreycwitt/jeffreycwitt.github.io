         <p>This course will introduce students to the basic components of logical arguments 
            and then introduce students to the various systems of logic designed to formally analyze
            such arguments. 
            Particular attention will be given to Categorical Logic, Propositional Logic, and
            Predicate Logic.</p>

            <h3 id="">Homework Problem Sets (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               This is a skills course designed, not only to introduce you to various formal systems
               of logic, but also to help you develop corresponding "habits" of mind. Such habits,
               just like in music, sport, or language acquisition, cannot be acquired with frequent
               and repetitive practice. Thus the main homework for this course are problems sets,
               and we will have assigned problems sets for nearly every class. A detailed problem
               set schedule has been posted on moodle. There are two parts to each problem set. One
               part indicates problems that you should complete, but do not need to turn. A second,
               smaller set, lists problems that you should complete and turn in via moodle.
               </p>
            
            <p>
               Turned in problems will be graded on "check" (8), "check plus" (9), "check plus plus"
               (10) system. 
               A "check" (8) represents a floor. If you've done your best and made a sincere attempt
               on the homework, you'll get a check. If you've got nearly everything correct but missed
               one or two problems, you'll get a "check plus" (9), and if there are no errors you'll
               get a (10). As such, the incentive to not do your own work is very low. Copying an
               answer from the internet or a friend provides you with only a marginal benefit, while
               robbing you have the knowledge required to do well on the much more important exams.
               At the same time, since the turn-in homework problems are generally the more difficult
               problems, the small bump from getting a 9 or 10 should incentivize you to faithfully
               and regularly do the non turn-in homework problems.</p>
            
            <p>
               In short, the exams presume that you've done all the homework problems, so there is
               little incentive to finding a short-cut only to get 100% on homework, since doing
               poorly on exams is much more damaging. At the same time, the small bump should incentive
               you to do the homework well (and therefore enable you to do well on exams) since a
               strong homework grade can help push your final grade up or down.
               </p>
            
            <p>
               There are approximately 20 homework opportunities. Since I know everyone has busy
               weeks, I'll drop your three lowest homework scores.

            <p>
               During our course we will have two "reading" analysis where will look at arguments
               and/or articles in the "wild" and use techniques we are learning to identify the structure
               of the argument and examine its strengths and weaknesses.

            <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
            
            <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
               entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
               The Students of this University understand that having collective and individual responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds demonstrate
               respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside resources
               or information should be clearly acknowledged.  If there is any doubt or question
               regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic assignments, your
               instructor should be consulted.  Any violations of the Honor Code will be handled
               by the Honor Council."</p>
            
            <p>See the honor code for further information. <a href="http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="">Computer, Cell Phones and Email Policy</h3>
            
            <p>I ask you not (unless otherwise instructed) to use your computers or cell phones in
               this class. They are almost always a
               distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special reason
               that you need 
               a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work something out.) Students
               using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation grade negatively affected.
               
               If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you to watch the Frontline
               documentary: Digital Nation
