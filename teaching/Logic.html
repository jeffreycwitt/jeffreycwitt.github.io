         <p>This course will introduce students to the basic components of logical arguments 
            and then introduce students to the various systems of logic designed to formally analyze
            such arguments. 
            Particular attention will be given to Categorical Logic, Propositional Logic, and
            Predicate Logic.

            <h3 id="">In-Class Participation (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>In-class participation is a small part of your grade that typically makes a big difference.
               
               Participation means not only attending class, but being prepared for class and letting
               that preparation bear fruit in class. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               In this class, preparation means completing the assigned exercise problems. 
               (Unless otherwise noted, this means the "odd" problems for each unit.)
               While homework will not be collected, 
               exercise problems reflect the kinds of problems you will encounter on class exams
               
               which are the bulk of your course grade. 
               Thus to do well on exams, it is imperative that you commit yourself 
               to completing the exercise problems in preparation for each class. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Most of our class time will involve going over these examples problems together. 
               
               During class time, you will be called on to share your work for particular problems.
               
               If you are not prepared for a particular question, you are welcome to make use of
               three "free passes." 
               Your participation grade will be reduced by a third for every pass beyond these three.
               
               Not being present for a class will count as using a pass.

            <h3 id="">Honor Code and Plagiarism</h3>
            
            <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
            
            <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
               entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
               The Students of this University understand that having collective and individual responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds demonstrate
               respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside resources
               or information should be clearly acknowledged.  If there is any doubt or question
               regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic assignments, your
               instructor should be consulted.  Any violations of the Honor Code will be handled
               by the Honor Council."
            </p>
            
            <p>See the honor code for further information. <a href="http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx</a>.

            <h3 id="">Computer, Cell Phones and Email Policy</h3>
            
            <p>I ask you not (unless otherwise instructed) to use your computers or cell phones in
               this class. They are almost always a
               distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special reason
               that you need 
               a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work something out.) Students
               using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation grade negatively affected.
               
               If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you to watch the Frontline
               documentary: Digital Nation
