         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p><em>Philosophy of the Person</em> is a two semester core course intended
            for students who plan to make a commitment to that course for the duration of the
            school
            year. The objectives of the course are two-fold. The first is to introduce students
            to the
            general history of philosophy. Second, within this general historical context, the
            course
            will focus on the development of a connected web of issues surrounding the human person
            and the good life. Students will be asked to absorb philosophy’s long preoccupation
            with
            these issues, recognize the perennial difficulties that arise, and actively reflect
            on the
            consequences of their own views of the human person.

            <p><em>Reading Quizzes (10%)</em>: One objective of this course is to be
               exposed to the classic texts of the history of philosophy and to develop reading
               comprehension of philosophical texts. Achieving this goal requires, at the very least,
               the simple act of forcing oneself to read and learning to read well. In order to
               facilitate the necessity of reading and preparation for class, we will have short
               reading quizzes at the beginning of each class twice a week. The quiz is meant to
               be
               short and succinct. It will not presume that you understood the text with perfection
               or
               memorized every detail. Rather, it simply presumes that you’ve prepared for class:
               which
               means you’ve read the text, and, with the help of reading questions, attempted to
               discern its general structure and main argument.
            </p>
            
            <p>Occasionally, reading quizzes may take a different form: namely, in a short in-class
               writing exercise, which will ask you to reflect on the assigned reading. This will
               serve
               as good starting point to our in-class discussion.
            </p>
            
            <p>I will distribute reading questions for each assigned reading. These questions are
               designed to focus your reading and to draw your attention to important aspects that
               will
               likely come up in class. Questions from the reading quizzes will often pertain to
               these
               reading questions (though not in all cases).
            </p>
            
            <p>Rather than distinguishing between excused and unexcused absences, I will simply drop
               your lowest five quiz grades. If circumstances (i.e. health or family emergencies)
               require you to miss more than five classes, please let me know and we will find a
               different solution. Quizzes will begin promptly at the beginning of class and cannot
               be
               made up, so come to class and be on time.

            <h3 id="">Explications (20%)</h3>
            
            <p>These ‘explications’ represent an opportunity to sharpen your reading comprehension
               of
               philosophical texts and to increase your ability to discern the essential from the
               inessential. It is also an exercise in faithfully explicating someone else’s reasoning
               and being able to quickly and accurately present the core of their argument (an
               essential skill for constructing your larger arguments about the views of others).
               ‘Explications’ are meant to be written in prose form, but are neither a summary nor
               a
               mere response. Rather, they are a presentation of the essence of a given text that
               traces the flow and logic of the argument and insightfully anticipates its consequences.
               In these ‘explications’, I am looking to see if you can grasp the important components
               of an argument, see how they fit together, and follow them to their conclusion. These
               ‘explications’ should always aim at brevity and succinctness; nothing should be said
               that is not crucial to the argument being made. For this reason, <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">they
                  are limited to 350 words</em>. I will be fastidious about this word count in my
               grading! It should be very hard to meet this word count. The writing process should
               involve repeated revision and removal of the inessential. If you commit to this process,
               you will be surprised at how much you can fit in a small space, and at how many
               redundant things can be removed. ‘Explications’ are also an opportunity for me to
               give
               feedback on your writing and for you to internalize that feedback and gradually improve
               your writing over the course of the semester. Late ‘explications’ will not be
               accepted.

            <h3 id="">Papers (2) (45%)</h3>
            
            <p>There will be two papers (5 pages) during the course of the semester. Prompts will
               be
               distributed in advance to guide your writing. The goal of each of these papers is
               to
               identify a motivating question or problem that you think some of the authors we’ve
               considered can help illuminate, solve, or clarify. Your task is to defend a thesis
               regarding how this author contributes to the resolution of the posed problem.

            <h3 id="">Final Exam (20%)</h3>
            
            <p>The cumulative final exam will include short fact based questions, quotation
               identification, and a few short essay questions focusing on core concepts and problems
               discussed during the course of the semester.

            <h3 id="">Computer and Email Policy</h3>
            
            <p>I ask you not to use your computers in this class. They are almost always a
               distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special reason
               that
               a computer is needed, please let me know, and we can mostly likely work something
               out.)
               If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you to watch the Frontline
               documentary: Digital Nation
               <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=               viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=
                  viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid</a>. I have posted this link on
               BlackBoard.
            </p>
            
            <p>Papers will not be accepted via email. Please print out hard copies and turn them
               in
               during class. If, for some reason, this is not possible, a hard copy in my mailbox
               is
               the next best option. Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me
               about
               emergencies, but about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to face.
               This
               is what office hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office hours conflict
               with your schedule, I will be glad to work with you to find a time that does fit.
