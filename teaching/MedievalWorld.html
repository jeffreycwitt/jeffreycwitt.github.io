         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p>This seminar course will examine the period of history spanning from 400 to 1500 C.E.,
            often referred to as the Middle Ages. 
            We will examine this period from multiple dimensions, 
            looking at the historical development of social ideas, theology, philosophy, and literature.
            
            As we will see, it is an extremely diverse period, and the seminar format will provide
            us with 
            significant time to reflect and debate the ways in which this period does and does
            not represent a unified whole. 
            Further, in keeping with our Messina theme, "Self and Other," this course will consider
            the ways different thinkers, 
            writers, and political actors have thought about the individual and the pursuit of
            happiness in the context of society and the outsider. 
            Finally, the course aims to provide space to reflect on the ways in which the Middle
            Ages influence and challenge 
            our own assumptions about ourselves and our place in society.

         <p>Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of principle actors, historical developments,
            and foundational texts from the period 400-1500 C.E.
         </p>
         
         <p>Students will be able to examine and articulate connections between developments in
            medieval history, literature, philosophy, and theology.
         </p> 
         
         <p>Students will be able to converse cogently about the Middle Ages as an idea and as
            a historical reality.

            <h3 id="">Participation (10%)</h3>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">In-class Participation (5%):</em> 
               In-class involvement is a small part of your grade that typically makes a big difference.
               
               Class involvement means, first of all, coming to class. Secondly, it means coming
               to class prepared. 
               This primarily means having both read the assigned text and prepared yourself to engage
               in discussion. 
               To facilitate this preparation, we will have a discussion board for each assigned
               reading along with guided reading questions. 
               I encourage you to post short responses and/or comments to the discussion board as
               you prepare the reading. 
               A good rule of thumb is to be contributing something to the discussion board at least
               once a week.
               Participation on the discussion board will count positively toward your participation
               grade. 
               Thirdly, strong participation means being an active participant in the classroom.
               
               It means speaking up and offering your thoughts and reflections. 
               Again, a good rule of thumb is to make sure you are contributing to the class discussion
               at least once a week.
               It also means being respectful and considerate of the other voices around the table.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Questions and Discussion Board (5%):</em>
               At the beginning of the course, you will be assigned responsibility for two class
               readings. 
               For those texts to which you’ve been assigned, you are responsible 
               for preparing a short summary and guided reading questions for the rest of the class.
               
               The goal of these questions is to identify core questions that emerge while reading
               the text. 
               These questions should not only help guide the reader through the text, 
               but also expose core issues, tensions, or problems that can guide our class discussion.
               
               Your questions should include at least five questions that aim to guide the reader
               through the content of the reading, 
               and at least two reflection questions. For those texts to which you have been assigned,
               
               I ask that you submit them to the class discussion board 24 hours prior to our scheduled
               class discussion.

            <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
            
            
            <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
               entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
               The Students of this University understand that having collective and individual responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds demonstrate
               respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside resources
               or information should be clearly acknowledged.  If there is any doubt or question
               regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic assignments, your
               instructor should be consulted.  Any violations of the Honor Code will be handled
               by the Honor Council."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>See the honor code for further information. <a href="http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.loyola.edu/academic/honorcode.aspx</a>.

            <h3 id="">Computer, Cell Phones and Email Policy</h3>
            
            <p>
               I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class (unless otherwise
               instructed). They are almost always a
               distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special reason
               that you need 
               a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work something out.) Students
               using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation grade negatively affected.
               
               If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you to watch the Frontline
               documentary: Digital Nation
               <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=

            </p>
            
            <p>
               Papers will not be accepted via email. Please print out hard copies and turn them
               in
               during class. If, for some reason, this is not possible, a hard copy in my mailbox
               is
               the next best option. Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me
               about
               emergencies, but, about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to face.
               This
               is what office hours are for. Do not be scared; I am nice! If my office hours conflict
               with your schedule, I will be glad to work with you to find a time that does fit.
