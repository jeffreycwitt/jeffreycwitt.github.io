         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p>This seminar course will examine the period of history spanning from 400 to 1500 C.E.,
            often referred to as the Middle Ages. 
            We will examine this period from multiple dimensions, 
            looking at the historical development of social ideas, theology, philosophy, and literature.
            
            As we will see, it is an extremely diverse period, and the seminar format will provide
            us with 
            significant time to reflect and debate the ways in which this period does and does
            not represent a unified whole. 
            Further, in keeping with our Messina theme, "Self and Other," this course will consider
            the ways different thinkers, 
            writers, and political actors have thought about the individual and the pursuit of
            happiness in the context of society and the outsider. 
            Finally, the course aims to provide space to reflect on the ways in which the Middle
            Ages influence and challenge 
            our own assumptions about ourselves and our place in society.

            <p>
               Class involvement means, first of
               all, coming to class. Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. This primarily
               means both having read the assigned text and having the day's reading out and ready
               to
               be marked. Thirdly, it means being an active participant in the classroom. At times
               we
               will have opportunities for discussion; someone who is involved in class will be a
               thoughtful and engaged participant in that discussion. At other times, lectures will
               solicit your input and/or questions; an engaged student will bring up helpful and
               appropriate questions and be able to make a positive contribution when class input
               is
               called upon.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               To encourage you in the above three areas. I will keep attendance throughout the
               course. Because I know that things come up, people get sick, and emergencies happen,
               I
               will overlook your first two absences (excused or otherwise). After two absences,
               every absence will affect your overall participation grade. Since our class is
               primarily devoted to the reading of texts, it is imperative that you have your text
               (including assigned PDFs available on Moodle) with you in class in a printed form
               that
               you can mark up and take notes on. Accordingly, not having the assigned reading with
               you will count as not being present. Inappropriate use of cell phones during class
               
               will likewise count as an absence. During on-line class meetings, 
               unless you have spoken to me beforehand, 
               it is expected that you keep your camera on and remain an engaged participant.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               To further encourage the kind preparation that yields fruit in the classroom, 
               we will use small reading quizzes and reading discussion boards throughout the semester.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Discussion Board (10%):</em>
               There will be approximately 12 available reading discussion boards.
               Because I know you will have busy weeks, 
               you do not need to participate in each discussion. But throughout the course of the
               semester, 
               you need to participate in 8 discussions. 
               (But as the goal of this assignment is to help you digest and actively respond to
               our reading, 
               you are encouraged to participate in any and all discussion forums).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               What does a full credit discussion forum participation look like? 
               To get credit you need to participate at least twice in any given discussion, 
               either by introducing a new topic/thread posing a question for the class
               or responding to a peer's original post or another response. 
               To encourage interaction, discussion boards will be limited to 3 topic threads; 
               after 3 threads have been initiated, you can then ONLY respond to an existing thread
               or 
               another person's response.
               A general guideline for a good question or response is that 
               it should be "substantive" "interesting" and "relevant".
               Make sure to clearly explain the substance of the issue ("substantive"), show us its
               significance ("interesting"), 
               and show us how it connects to the reading or previous discussion ("relevant"). 
               While I'm not looking for an exact word count, 
               you will need enough words to say something "substantive". 
               This will usually take at least 100 to 200 words. 
               Posts substantially below this threshold or 
               that do not extend the conversation will not receive full participation credit. 
               In other words, avoid posts that simply say "I agree with what you said" or "I like
               what you said".
               (Full credit is marked as a "93"; partial credit is marked as an "80")
               Finally, <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">discussion board posts will close at 9am the day of the assigned class discussion</em>. 
               So please do not wait until the last minute. To have a vibrant discussion, 
               we will need topics and threads to be initiated before the discussion board deadline.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Reading Quizzes (10%):</em>
               To help push you and hold you accountable for the readings and plenary lectures
               there will be 10 quiz opportunities throughot the semester
               Again, I know that you will sometimes have busy weeks or unexpected life events will
               arise, 
               thus you do not need to do all 10 quizzes. You are expected to complete 8 quizzes
               
               throughout the course of the semester. 
               If you do more than 8, I will count your highest 8 and drop your lowest 2.
               Quizzes will <em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">only be open until 9:25/12:15pm (i.e. the start of class)</em>
               the day of the assigned class discussion. 
               After that, the quiz will close.

               "The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola community have been equally
               entrusted
               by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments. Our goal
               is to
               foster a trusting atmosphere that is ideal for learning. In order to achieve this
               goal, every
               student must be actively committed to this pursuit and its responsibilities, and is
               therefore
               called to be active in the governing of the community‚Äôs standards. Thus, all students
               have the
               right, as well as the duty, to expect honest work from their colleagues. From this,
               we students
               will benefit and learn from the caring relationships that our community trustfully
               embodies.
               
               The students of this University understand that accepting collective and individual
               responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who
               submit materials that are the products of their own mind demonstrate respect for themselves
               and
               the community in which they study. These students possess a strong sense of honor,
               reverence for
               truth, and a commitment to Jesuit education. Accordingly, students found violating
               the Honor Code
               will be reprimanded appropriately in the belief that they will, with the support of
               their peers, learn
               from the mistake.
               
               This Code not only requires students to understand the ideals of truth and personal
               care as
               the two strongest educational factors expressed in cura personalis, but also calls
               them to
               demonstrate a general concern for the welfare of their colleagues and for the University."

            <p>
               Remember that while you have five teachers, I have more than 70 students. 
               Thus, while I'm eager to connect with you, 
               I can do this best by enforcing a few procedures. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               For questions about the course, both content and procedure questions, 
               please use our moodle help discussion board. 
               Using this system will help ensure that I see and respond to your email. 
               It will additionally ensure that others who have similar questions can also receive
               an answer. 
               
               So, if you send me a direct email about course content and procedure, 
               I will politely ask you to ask it again via our moodle "help" discussion board 
               and I will be eager and glad to respond.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               For other issues, I will be glad to discuss these with you.
               But I would ask that you use our office hours booking service 
               and reserve a time slot to discuss it with me. 
               We can generally always communicate better when we speak in person 
               and this is an opportunity for me to get to know you better. 
               This also helps me manage my time and provide you with the best response I can.
               So again, if you send me a direct email, I'll will be glad to discuss it with you,
               
               but I will often direct you to the booking system 
               so that we can schedule a chance to talk about the issue.
