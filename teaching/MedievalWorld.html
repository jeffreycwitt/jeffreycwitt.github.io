         <h2 id="">Course Description:</h2>
         
         <p>This seminar course will examine the period of history spanning from 400 to 1500 C.E.,
            often referred to as the Middle Ages. 
            We will examine this period from multiple dimensions, 
            looking at the historical development of social ideas, theology, philosophy, and literature.
            
            As we will see, it is an extremely diverse period, and the seminar format will provide
            us with 
            significant time to reflect and debate the ways in which this period does and does
            not represent a unified whole. 
            Further, in keeping with our Messina theme, "Self and Other," this course will consider
            the ways different thinkers, 
            writers, and political actors have thought about the individual and the pursuit of
            happiness in the context of society and the outsider. 
            Finally, the course aims to provide space to reflect on the ways in which the Middle
            Ages influence and challenge 
            our own assumptions about ourselves and our place in society.</p>

            <p>
               Class involvement means, first of all, coming to class. 
               Secondly, it means coming to class prepared. 
               This primarily means both having read the assigned text and having the day's reading
               out and ready to be marked. 
               Thirdly, it means being an active participant in the classroom.
               Finally, participation includes attendance and engagement during Messina EH, Messina
               events (and post event discussions), and plenary lectures.
               Lack of participation in these areas will negatively affect your overall participation
               grade.
               After 3 missed classes, participation grade will be reduced by 3% per missed class.
               (And missing more than 75% scheduled classes is grounds for not passing the course.)

               "The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola community have been equally
               entrusted
               by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments. Our goal
               is to
               foster a trusting atmosphere that is ideal for learning. In order to achieve this
               goal, every
               student must be actively committed to this pursuit and its responsibilities, and is
               therefore
               called to be active in the governing of the community’s standards. Thus, all students
               have the
               right, as well as the duty, to expect honest work from their colleagues. From this,
               we students
               will benefit and learn from the caring relationships that our community trustfully
               embodies.
               
               The students of this University understand that accepting collective and individual
               responsibility
               for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.
               Students who
               submit materials that are the products of their own mind demonstrate respect for themselves
               and
               the community in which they study. These students possess a strong sense of honor,
               reverence for
               truth, and a commitment to Jesuit education. Accordingly, students found violating
               the Honor Code
               will be reprimanded appropriately in the belief that they will, with the support of
               their peers, learn
               from the mistake.
               
               This Code not only requires students to understand the ideals of truth and personal
               care as
               the two strongest educational factors expressed in cura personalis, but also calls
               them to
               demonstrate a general concern for the welfare of their colleagues and for the University."

               free from sexual and gender-based misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual
               verbal abuse, 
               sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation.
               
               Reports of such offenses are taken seriously, 
               and Loyola encourages students experiencing sexual misconduct 
               to report the incident in accordance with the University’s policy on Reporting Misconduct
               (PDF) (pages 36-37). 
               Loyola is also committed to an environment free of other forms of harassment and discrimination.

            <p>
               Remember that while you have five teachers, I have more than 70 students. 
               Thus, while I'm eager to connect with you, 
               I can do this best by enforcing a few procedures. 
               </p>
            
            <p>
               For questions about the course, both content and procedure questions, 
               please use our moodle help discussion board. 
               Using this system will help ensure that I see and respond to your email. 
               It will additionally ensure that others who have similar questions can also receive
               an answer. 
               
               So, if you send me a direct email about course content and procedure, 
               I will politely ask you to ask it again via our moodle "help" discussion board 
               and I will be eager and glad to respond.
               </p>
            
            <p>
               For other issues, I will be glad to discuss these with you.
               But I would ask that you use our office hours booking service 
               and reserve a time slot to discuss it with me. 
               We can generally always communicate better when we speak in person 
               and this is an opportunity for me to get to know you better. 
               This also helps me manage my time and provide you with the best response I can.
               So again, if you send me a direct email, I'll will be glad to discuss it with you,
               
               but I will often direct you to the booking system 
               so that we can schedule a chance to talk about the issue.
