         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p>This class will focus on the perennial tension between reason and faith and the history
            of philosophy's attempts to understand and articulate this relationship.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>The course will begin with an introduction to philosophy's efforts to define the criteria
            of true knowledge. We will quickly see that faith is typically defined as those beliefs
            that fail to meet the requirements of genuine knowledge. In failing to meet these
            requirements, we are left with the question: what are we to do with claims of faith
            and revelation? Can such claims be trusted? What is their value? And what is the connection
            between these claims and the claims of scientific reason?
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>The rest of the course will focus on the medieval and modern responses to these questions
            that form the backdrop of any contemporary discussion.

            <h3 id="">Participation (10%)</h3>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">In class participation:</em> Be a present and <em>active</em> participant in seminar discussions. The primary goal of a seminar course is not to
               come together to merely survey or review the contents of the required readings. On
               the contrary, class time is an opportunity for us to engage in a critical discussion
               and to evaluate the merits and implications of the day's reading. To that end, I expect
               that you come to the class after both reading and preparing notes (comments, questions,
               concerns) about the text that you can share during the seminar. Reading with a pencil
               and notebook in hand is a great practice for reading difficult texts and should become
               your regular habit. Outline the text as you read, marking questions and concerns as
               you go. Then, always bring your text and your notes to class. During our time together,
               I expect to be able to ask you not merely what the day's reading said, but what your
               reactions are to the argument of the text. What concerns do you have about the argument?
               What questions do you have about what the author said? What do you think the implications
               of the argument are? Occasionally, I may ask you to complete short reflections exercises
               and these will be included as a part of your in-class participation grade.
            </p>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Discussion Board Participation:</em> Regularly (at least once a week) post a substantial question or comment (100 words
               or more) in response to the day's reading. At least one contribution should be made
               for at least 10 of our approximately 15 weeks together. In order to count towards
               your participation grade, posts must be made prior to the class discussion of the
               reading in question. Additional comments and questions are encouraged and will positively
               impact your overall participation grade. This should be viewed as a forum to air topics
               of interest, questions, and frustrations that you would like to discuss during our
               seminar.

            <h3 id="">Research Paper (50%)</h3>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Preparation (15%):</em></p>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Problem Paper:</em> A short reflection paper that identifies the major problems, challenges, concerns
               that are characteristic of the debate surrounding the relationship and (in)compatibility
               of religious faith and scientific reason.
            </p>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Research Brainstorm:</em> A brief description of your ideas for your research paper to date and an annotated
               list of secondary sources (at least 10) that may assist you in the development or
               refinement of your question and/or thesis. Your annotations should briefly explain
               the potential relevance of each resource to your research paper.
            </p>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Polished Proposal:</em> A polished prose proposal that 1) articulates the main question you will pursue,
               2) the status of the current scholarly conversation about the question or problem,
               3) a provisional thesis, 4) an outline of how you will demonstrate and support your
               thesis, 5) a notes section that indicate aspects of the paper you are still thinking
               about, struggling with, or are confused about. The proposal is a chance for you to
               collect your developing thoughts into a presentable form that allows me to give you
               the best feedback I can. Thus, the proposal will not simply be graded on participation,
               but on the quality and thoughtfulness of your proposal. The more prepared you are
               at this stage, the more I can you help you produce a quality finished product. The
               proposal should be no more than three pages long, double spaced.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Final Paper (30%):</em></p>
            
            <p>A central task of this class is to produce a polished philosophy research paper. The
               paper is an invitation to participate in the larger historical debate over the proper
               relationship between faith and reason. The paper is your chance to pursue, in depth,
               a specific topic or question that really interests you.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>As this is a philosophy paper, it must include some important formal features. A good
               philosophy paper starts from a genuine question or puzzle. Your paper must identify
               a specific problem or issue that you ultimately hope to address or clarify in some
               way. However, before your paper can offer a response to that puzzle or question, it
               needs to take stock of the larger ongoing conversation regarding this topic. Here,
               engagement with secondary sources is particularly important. Your paper must aim to
               contribute to an ongoing conversation. Finally, your paper needs to offer a thesis
               in light of the problem at hand and the scholarly conversation surrounding it. Your
               thesis should introduce a strategy for moving this conversation forward. This does
               not always mean (in fact it usually does not mean) arguing for a definitive answer
               to the problem at hand. Often it means offering a helpful perspective, a criticism
               of potential answers, or insight into a promising route forward. In the context of
               our class work, your strategy for moving the conversation forward should involve some
               engagement with one or more thinkers that we have spent time with in class.
            </p> 
            
            
            <p>For example: your paper might propose the thesis that 'a close examination of the
               way Anselm uses his faith and his reason in tandem offers us a model of how faith
               can assist reason and at the same time avoid many of the conflicts that currently
               put the compatibility of faith and reason in doubt.' A paper with a thesis like this
               would need to do two things. 1) It would need to provide a clear and thoughtful analysis
               of Anselm's position and 2) it would need to demonstrate how this approach avoids
               some of the obstacles you would have presumably outlined in your introduction.
            </p> 
            
            
            <p>Your paper could offer a very different kind of approach as well. It could claim:
               'consistent flaws repeatedly occur in historical attempts to harmonize faith and reason
               and this suggests (this will be a large part of what you need to prove) that it is
               doubtful that faith and reason can every really be harmonized.' Here again, the body
               of your paper would need to clearly show the repeated flaws that occur in the historical
               accounts you choose to survey, and then persuasively show that this is evidence of
               the essential incompatibility between religious faith and scientific reason.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Your paper should be 10-15 pages, double spaced, following <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> formatting. It should strategically use primary and secondary sources. Most of all,
               it should be evident that this paper is the product of a semester's worth of thought
               and work and not the result of last minute harried composition.

            <h3 id="">Final Exam (35%)</h3>
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Thinker summaries (5%):</em> "Thinker summaries" are encyclopedic-like reports that are meant to be an occasion
               for you to consolidate your notes, fill in gaps, and generally help you to prepare
               for the final exam throughout the semester rather than merely at the end. This is
               an assignment designed to help you help yourself. Thus, I will primarily be looking
               to see that a number of formal features are present. 1) A biographical introduction
               highlighting information relevant to the thinker's unique perspective on the relationship
               between faith and reason. 2) A list and description of distinctive positions taken
               by the thinker in question, including book and page references for further consultation,
               and 3) a annotated list of three or more useful secondary articles, at least one of
               which was not assigned as part of the class reading.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Final Exam (30%):</em> The cumulative final exam aims to assess the degree to which you've grasped the basic
               positions and ideas of the thinkers we've studied, as well as perennial themes and
               concepts that emerge throughout our survey. It will include multiple choice questions,
               quotation identification, short answer, and an essay question.

            <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
            
            
            <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
               entrusted by their 
               peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments. The Students of
               this University understand that having collective and individual responsibility for
               the 
               ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to the community.  Students
               who submit 
               materials that are the products of their own minds demonstrate respect for themselves
               and the community 
               in which they study. All outside resources or information should be clearly acknowledged.
               If there is any doubt or question 
               regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic assignments, your
               instructor should 
               be consulted.  Any violations of the Honor Code will be handled by the Honor Council."

            <p>I ask you not to use your computers or cell phones in this class. They are almost
               always a
               distraction: if not to you, then to me and to others. (If there is a special reason
               that you need 
               a computer please let me know, and we can most likely work something out.) Students
               using cell phones in any capacity will find their participation grade negatively affected.
               
               If you find this policy frustrating, then I encourage you to watch the Frontline
               documentary: Digital Nation

            <p>Papers will not be accepted via email. Please print out hard copies and turn them
               in
               during class. If, for some reason, this is not possible, a hard copy in my mailbox
               is
               the next best option. Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me
               about
               emergencies, but about most other things, I prefer to meet with you face to face.
               This
