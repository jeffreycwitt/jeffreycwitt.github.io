         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p>
            Today we are living through one of human history's great media shifts, on par with
            the invention of the written language and the printing press. 
            A shift of this magnitude invites philosophical reflection: 
            both historical and phenomenological reflections on the nature of information and
            a general examination of the way media affects consciousness. 
            
            In this course, we will consider the history of media shifts and their impact by looking
            at thinkers as diverse as Plato and Marshall McLuhan, Immanuel Kant and Ted Nelson.
            
            After first tracing the history of the "informational turn", we will then look at
            the impact of media shifts on the way we think about texts, and the nature of reading
            and writing. 
            Finally we will look at the social implications of these shifts, 
            considering especially the values of a deliberative democracy 
            and how digital media positively or negatively affect our pursuit of those values.

            <h3 id="">Participation (25%)</h3>
            
            <p>Annotation Participation (20%):
               Involvement in the class discussion will be one of the most essential activities of
               this course. 
               Our small seminar format offers us the chance to do more than simply passively consume
               what others have written. 
               We have the opportunity to be active participants in this discussion.
               The opportunity to participate in this discussion will begin asynchronously as we
               prepare and respond to the readings for each class period. 
               We will be using an "annotation tool" called "hypothes.is" to facilitate this discussion.
               
               Please the annotation discussion handout for a description of participation expectations
               and grading rubric.
               Our "synchronous" discussion will build off of this discussion and largely revolve
               around the questions 
               and ideas that have emerged during our asynchronous discussion.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Journal Reflections (5%):
               Because this is a class about our encounters with information through diverse media
               forms, 
               and this is something we do everyday, we need to be reflecting critically on our own
               experience. 
               To help with this reflection, I ask that you keep a small journal (via moodle) 
               where you document the kinds of information you encounter over the semester (in this
               class and others), 
               the media through which you encountered it, and the various kinds of effects that
               resulted.
               While I'm not looking for a specific word count per journal entry, 
               I'm looking for something that is "substantive, interesting, and relevant".
               I would like to see at least 10 entries spread across at least 10 weeks. 
               But feel free to write as often as you would like.
               
            </p>

            <h3 id="">Information Applied (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>Class Presentation (2.5%) and Written Review (7.5%): 
               Working in groups I will ask you to take responsibility for a few different chapters
               in our course sequence. 
               I'll ask your group to make a presentation of your findings, and then submit a written
               report.

            <h3 id="">Digital Edition Review (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>Class Presentation (2.5%) and Written Review (12.5%): 
               Working in pairs, I will ask you select an online digital edition and evaluate its
               use of the digital medium. 
               I will ask you to give a small in class presentation and submit a written review.

            <h3 id="">Regulation Proposals (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>As a final paper, I will ask you to absorb our readings about "Deliberative Democracy",
               
               and the effect new and old communications media have on the possibility of "Deliberative
               Democracy".
               Then in light of our considerations of various types of social regulation, 
               I will ask you to offer some policy proposals for how to best shape the internet 
               in a way that would further the life and health of a deliberative democracy.

               from Gleick
            </p>
            
            <p>Final Exam (20%): We will have a cumulative final exam covering the material discussed
               throughout the course of the semester.

         <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
         
         
         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The
            Students of this University understand that having collective and individual
            responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to
            the
            community. Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds
            demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside
            resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt or
            question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor Code
            will
            be handled by the Honor Council."

         <p>
            Remember that while you have five teachers, I have more than 70 students. 
            Thus, while I'm eager to connect with you, 
            I can do this best by enforcing a few procedure. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            For questions about the course, both content and procedure questions, 
            please use our moodle help discussion board. 
            Using this system will help ensure that I see and respond to your email. 
            It will additionally ensure that others who have similar questions can also receive
            an answer. 
            
            So, if you send me a direct email about course content and procedure, 
            I will politely ask you to ask it via our moodle "help" discussion board 
            and I will be eager and glad to respond.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            For other issues, I will be glad to discuss these with you.
            But I would ask that you try to use our booking service 
            and reserve a time slot to discuss it with me. 
            We can generally always communicate better when we speak in person 
            and this is an opportunity for me to get to know you better. 
            This also helps me manage my time and provide you with the best response I can.
            
            So again, if you send me a direct email, I'll will be glad to discuss it with you,
            
            but I will often direct you to the booking system 
            so that we can schedule a chance to talk about the issue.

         <h2 id="">Zoom Participation and Zoom Recording Policy</h2>
         
         <p>During our live Zoom sessions, the expectation is that your video is on, unless there
            is a reason for it not to be on, such as poor internet connectivity or student concerns
            about privacy in a shared living or work environment. 
            If there are valid reasons why someone may not be able to participate via video and
            sound during our Zoom discussion period, please schedule any appointment with me to
            discuss alternative ways of ensuring attendance and participation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Class sessions conducted via Zoom may be visually and audio-recorded for later reference
            by students and approved faculty and staff associated with the class (e.g., Messina
            instructors and administrator).  Students who participate with their video-feeds activated
            or use a personal image on their Zoom profile acknowledge and agree that their videos
            and/or profile images will be recorded.  If you do not wish to have your video and/or
            profile image recorded, ensure that your camera is turned off and do not use a personal
            image on your Zoom profile.  Likewise, any students who un-mute their audio during
            class and participate orally in class agree to have their voices recorded.  If you
            do not wish to have your voice recorded in a class recording, ensure that you have
            muted your Zoom audio prior to the beginning of class.
