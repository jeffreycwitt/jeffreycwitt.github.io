         <h2 id="">Course Description</h2>
         
         <p>
            Today we are living through one of human history's great media shifts, on par with
            the invention of the written language and the printing press. 
            A shift of this magnitude invites philosophical reflection: 
            both historical and phenomenological reflections on the nature of information and
            a general examination of the way media affects consciousness. 
            
            In this course, we will consider the history of media shifts and their impact by looking
            at thinkers as diverse as Plato and Marshall McLuhan, Immanuel Kant and Ted Nelson.
            
            After first tracing the history of the "informational turn", we will then look at
            the impact of media shifts on the way we think about texts, and the nature of reading
            and writing. 
            Finally we will look at the social implications of these shifts, 
            considering especially the values of a deliberative democracy 
            and how digital media positively or negatively affect our pursuit of those values.

            <h3 id="">Annotation Participation (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>
               Involvement in the class discussion will be one of the most essential activities of
               this course. 
               Our small seminar format offers us the chance to do more than simply passively consume
               what others have written. 
               We have the opportunity to be active participants in this discussion.
               The opportunity to participate in this discussion will begin asynchronously as we
               prepare and respond to the readings and course notes for each class period. 
               We will be using an "annotation tool" called "hypothes.is" to facilitate this discussion.
               
               Please see the <a href="https://jeffreycwitt.com/pl339/docs/annotation-expectations.html" target="_blank">annotation participation and expectations</a>  for a description of participation expectations and grading rubric.
               Our "synchronous" discussion will build off of this discussion and largely revolve
               around the questions 
               and ideas that have emerged during our asynchronous discussion. 
               Accordingly, attendance in class, and the willingness/ability to review and expand
               annotations during class will 
               be a part of this participation grade. While I understand that things come up and
               sometimes classes have to 
               be missed, it goes with out saying that attendance is a necessary condition for this
               kind of participation. 
               Thus, after 3 missed classes, the total annotation participation grade will be reduced
               by 3% per missed class.

            <p>As a final paper, I will ask you to reflect our course theme -- the medium is the
               message -- 
               and explore a concrete case where the medium or a media shift is affecting consciousness
               and 
               behavior in new ways. Given these changes, and in light of our exploration of various
               types of social regulation, 
               I will ask you to offer (and defend) a policy proposal for how to best to regulate
               
               the medium (and/or human behavior) in a way that would further 
               the life and health of a deliberative democracy.

            Email is useful for setting up appointments or informing me about emergencies, but

         <h2 id="">Honor Code and Plagiarism</h2>
         
         <p>Students are expected to follow the university's honor code:</p>
         
         <p>"The Honor Code states that all students of the Loyola Community have been equally
            entrusted by their peers to conduct themselves honestly on all academic assignments.
            The
            Students of this University understand that having collective and individual
            responsibility for the ethical welfare of their peers exemplifies a commitment to
            the
            community. Students who submit materials that are the products of their own minds
            demonstrate respect for themselves and the community in which they study. All outside
            resources or information should be clearly acknowledged. If there is any doubt or
            question regarding the use and documentation of outside sources for academic
            assignments, your instructor should be consulted. Any violations of the Honor Code
            will
            be handled by the Honor Council."
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Statement on Generative-AI: This course focuses on skill building in the areas of
            close reading, 
            argument analysis, and creative reflection. As such (and as stated in the above honor
            code) 
            it is expected that in this course your compositions are self-generated. 
            While there are many legitimate reasons to use and value generative-AI tools, 
            the goal of this class is to cultivate the very analytic and synthetic skills that
            are needed to use AI tools well. 
            Therefore outsourcing our class exercises, just as outsourcing drills in athletics,
            defeats the purpose.
            Thus, in this class, the above Honor Code includes the expectation 
            that your submitted responses and compositions are always self-generated. 
            When an AI detection tool indicates and high probability that the work was produced
            with AI, 
            I will submit the assignment to the university honor council for review.
