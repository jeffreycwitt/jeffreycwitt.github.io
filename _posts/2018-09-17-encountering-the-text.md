Below is a list of readings I would like to use to structure our seminar.

Given the various time commitments we all have, I know that, despite best intentions, it is not always possible to do all the readings before a seminar. At the same time, our seminar will be infinitely more enriching if participants can devote some time to reading preparation.

In order to make it easier for everyone to do a least some reading, I have indicated readings that are considered **focused** readings and those that are **recommended** or **highly recommended**. Please prioritize **focused** readings over **recommended** readings.

Additionally, for **focused** readings, I've also try to indicate even smaller page ranges which constitute the core of what I would like to focus on during our time together. Obviously, the contents within these pages ranges will be more rewarding if one can read them in the context of the entire text. But if one is pressed for time, concentrating attention on these pages ranges will allow us to come together with some common understanding of the issues at play and will hopefully enable a rewarding discussion.

Each reading below has a file reference. During the course of the seminar, files corresponding to these references will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cZlar7NtUIQlWvdu_yleNudahxjH6_XD?usp=sharing). If possible, I recommend printing the **focused** readings out, so that during the seminar we can draw our attention toward each other and away from our screens.
