##### Workshop Proposal and Call for Papers for:

#### XIXth International Conference on Patristics Studies
Oxford University

### The Greek Fathers in Late Medieval Philosophy and Theology

Organized by John T. Slotemaker, Fairfield University and Jeffrey C. Witt, Loyola University Maryland

<hr/>

The XIXth Oxford Patristics Conference (hereafter OPC) will take place in the Examination Schools on High Street, Oxford during August 5-9, 2024. The general call for papers has been issued (see: [www.oxfordpatristics.com](www.oxfordpatristics.com)) and the deadline for both short communications (i.e., individual papers) and workshops is 31 December 2023. The present call for papers is to organize a workshop on The Greek Fathers in Late Medieval Philosophy and Theology within the nachleben (lit. 'after life') subdivision of the OPC. This subdivision treats the reception of the patristic tradition within subsequent Church history.

Within the OPC a workshop is defined as a conglomerate of up to 12 papers focused on an individual theme that leads to a separate *Studia Patristica* volume dedicated to the topic at hand. The goal of the present workshop is to organize a group of 12 papers that examine the reception of the Greek Fathers from the twelfth century up through the sixteenth century. While there is substantial research on the reception of Augustine, and other Latin Fathers, in the medieval and early modern era, there is relatively little research focused on the use of the Greek Patristic tradition.  As such, the organizers welcome paper proposals examining all aspects of the reception of the Greek patristic tradition in late medieval philosophy or theology. 

We welcome, for example, proposals examining Greek Patristic authors as authoritative sources in the Sentences commentary tradition, late-medieval biblical commentaries and preaching, late-medieval philosophical and scientific texts, second (early-modern) scholasticism, early 16th-century Reformation debates, etc. 

We especially encourage submissions from graduate students and early career scholars.
