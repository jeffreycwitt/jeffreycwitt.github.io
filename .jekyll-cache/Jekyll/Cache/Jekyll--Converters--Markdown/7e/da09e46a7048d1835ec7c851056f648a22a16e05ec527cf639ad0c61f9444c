I"™<p>In this demo, I‚Äôd like to show some of the early realizations of a system of quality control and imprimatur that can travel with an edition, freeing it from the confines of a particular publisher or particular presentation. In an <a href="http://lombardpress.org/2016/05/19/the-traveling-imprimatur">earlier post</a>, I described an early conception of this idea as a ‚Äútraveling imprimatur‚Äù, but of late I have had some requests for live demonstrations of how this might work in production rather than just in theory. So here I want to offer a few more thoughts about why this idea is important before offering a video demonstration of this idea working in production.</p>
