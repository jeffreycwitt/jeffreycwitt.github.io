<p>a workshop organized by John T. Slotemaker, Fairfield University and Jeffrey C. Witt, Loyola University Maryland</p>

<hr />

<p>The XVIIIth Oxford Patristics Conference (hereafter OPC) will take place in the Examination Schools on High Street, Oxford during August of 2019. The general call for papers has been issued (see: www.oxfordpatristics.com) and the deadline for both short communications and workshops is 31 August 2018. The present call for papers is to organize a workshop on <em>Politics and Society: The Patristic Legacy in the Middle Ages</em> within the <em>nachleben</em> (lit. â€˜afterlifeâ€™) subdivision of the OPC.</p>

<p>The theme of this yearâ€™s workshop is <em>Politics and Society</em> broadly conceived. We invite proposals that examine how medieval thinkers used the Patristic inheritance to develop their own political and social worldviews. Papers might address questions such as: How Patristics authors shaped the way medieval thinkers theorized the proper relationship between church and state, or an individual to his or her family? How particular Patristic quotations were used or misused to support various medieval political or social agendas? How Patristic authors encouraged or prevented medieval multi-cultural or inter-religious interactions? How Patristic authors were used to shape law (civil or canon) and legal institutions? How Patristic authors were used to guide or direct various social practices such as baptism, marriage, or last rites?</p>

<p>The theme is meant broadly and we are eager to consider proposals from a wide variety of points of view, including historical, theological, philosophical, sociological, etc. We are likewise interested in expanding our horizons and expectations of where Patristic sources were used in the Middle Ages: to that end, we encourage papers that look beyond the scholasticism of the 13th century chronologically (looking at both the early middle ages and the later middle ages) and employ a variety of sources (i.e., looking at theological treatises, canon law, biblical commentaries, sermons, etc.).</p>

<p>If you wish to join this workshop please consider submitting a proposal to John Slotemaker or Jeff Witt (<a href="mailto:johnslotemaker@gmail.com">johnslotemaker@gmail.com</a>, <a href="mailto:jeffreycwitt@gmail.com">jeffreycwitt@gmail.com</a>). We will accepting proposals for this workshop up through 30 June 2018. The workshop will consist of 12 papers with each paper given 20 minutes with 10 minutes for discussion. At the conclusion of the workshop participants will be invited to submit their contributions as part of collected volume to be published with Studia Patristica.</p>

<p><em>Nota bene</em>: by accepting your proposal we will assume your participation in the workshop and your desire to publish the essay with <em>Studia Patristica</em>.</p>
