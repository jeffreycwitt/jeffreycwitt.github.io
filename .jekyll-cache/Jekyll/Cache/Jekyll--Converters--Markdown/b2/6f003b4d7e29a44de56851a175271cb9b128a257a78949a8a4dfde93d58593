<hr />

<p>The XVIIIth Oxford Patristics Conference (hereafter OPC) will take place in the Examination Schools on High Street, Oxford during August of 2023. The general call for papers has been issued (see: <a href="www.oxfordpatristics.com">www.oxfordpatristics.com</a> and the deadline for both short communications (i.e., individual papers) and workshops is 31 December 2022. The present call for papers is to organize a workshop on The Greek Fathers in Late Medieval Philosophy and Theology within the nachleben (lit. â€˜after lifeâ€™) subdivision of the OPC. This subdivision treats the reception of the patristic tradition within subsequent Church history.</p>

<p>Within the OPC a workshop is defined as a conglomerate of up to 12 papers focused on an individual theme that leads to a separate Studia Patristica volume dedicated to the topic at hand. The goal of the present workshop is to organize a group of 10 to 12 papers that examine the reception of the Greek Fathers from the twelfth century up through the sixteenth century. While there is substantial research on the reception of Augustine, and other Latin Fathers, in the medieval and early modern era, there is relatively little research focused on the use of the Greek Patristic tradition.  As such, the organizers welcome paper proposals examining all aspects of the reception of the Greek patristic tradition in late medieval philosophy or theology. In particular, we welcome proposals examining Greek authors as authoritative sources in: Pre-Lombardian theology (e.g., Peter Abelard, Anselm, et al.); Peter Lombardâ€™s Sentences; the Sentences commentary tradition, early 16th-century Reformational debates, medieval biblical commentaries and preaching, etc.</p>
